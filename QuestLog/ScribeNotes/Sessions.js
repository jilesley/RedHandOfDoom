`{[h]The new campaign begins}
Aww yeah, it's monologue time.
Cyre was a nation of beauty. No longer.
[Five seconds in and I can't spell any of these goddamn names.]
The Last War ravaged Khorvaire for 102 years and was seemingly endless. But end it did. Some say it started in Metrol. But there are no true answers. No-one knows the origins of the mists either, but they covered the whole of Cyre, killing everything within, and stopped at the exact border.
The precious few who escaped were taken in by the kingdom of Breland. It is said that a new home is being built for refugees in the Elsir Vale.
This is where our story begins.
A lone cart at the back of the convoy, is surrounded by four figures. Two children, a boy of 6 (Merahl?) and a girl of 9 (Treza? Tressa?), are harassing a gruff, older gentleman. They call him Mr Seamus. What at first appears to be a tattoo on his arm is in fact metal bands welded into his skin. In the back of the cart is a heavily pregnant half-elven lady (Elaine?)
The children ask "Mr Red Skin" if he wants to join in. This is Brande of Kenna, a genasi. His long orange hair flits back and forth as the wind blows around. They are interrupted by a whistle.
Further up the caravan is a gnomish man, fairly unassuming. If he were human, you would assume he's in his mid-forties. Looks fairly friendly. This is Vilgrim. He whistles, and a magpie lands on his arm. The bird has found a coin. A red-haired human hops down from a cart near him, wearing a short bow. She's interested in how the gnomish man trained his magpie, called Jastiz. She's nicknamed Robin. She asks the half-elven man next to Vilgrim what he thinks of the bird. He's dressed in traveller's clothes, but looking closely reveals they are slightly finer cut than normal. He also has a side cape and a sword. Angelo the bard replies politely, "It's lovely, but it would be better if it wasn't attached to my keeper." Vilgrim grins at that.
Gareth, a dwarven man, is also with them, looking a bit dishevelled. Probably needs a wash. "Do you live in a forest?" Robin asks. Gareth confirms, as he's a druid, and Robin asks which one. Oops, we don't know yet. Gonna have to scroll along the map for a bit.
They are interrupted by the same whistle, and Robin says we should go and investigate. The four of us follow. We find an armoured human woman, with her dark hair tied up to keep it out of her face. Along the left side of her face is a large scar and burn marks. This is Aleya. Beside her is a half orc with a grey-blue skin tone. Few inches over 6 foot tall. He's broad and muscular. The grey skin poking out of the edge of his sleeve clearly shows what pretty much all of us recognise as a dragonmark. This is Ganraz.
Ganraz and Aleya can see a heavyset man with a clockwork hand and a metal plate welded to his forehead. Despite them interrupting him, he doesn't notice them, continuing to tell yet another war story which he'd been telling for the past 9 days. Marcos ___. He's in charge of the guard detail.
The whistle sounds again, and Marcos calls the caravan to a stop. It's his scout signalling him.
Sitting in the front stagecoach is a wizened old man. It's the stagehouse of House Crystol? He asks if there's a reason why we've stopped. Marcos tells him the scout has noticed something around the bend up ahead. He tells Ganraz to grab some willing individuals and go check what's blocking the road.
Whilst we wait for Seamus to regain consciousness due to his temporarily absent player, Brande climbs a slope to try and get a good viewpoint. Because he rolled a 1 +3, he hasn't gotten to a very good vantage point. He can't really see anything.
Brande, yelling down to the group: THERE'S NOTHING UP HERE, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'VE STOPPED
Aleya: Why the fuck is he yelling
Seamus comes to join us, and asks what he missed. Angelo lets him know that the genasi of the group can't climb.
We follow Ganraz and Aleya to investigate, and see something like a giant bird in the middle of the road. After an investigation check, the druid concludes that he has never seen a bird in his life. Ganraz does a little bit better, noticing red on the feathers. It's either injured or dead. When they approach, they see it's a fallen gryphon.
Aleya says we should leave because it's most definitely a trap. Ganraz agrees, but also points out they need to move the bird at some point because it's blocking the road. The scout, Jen, doesn't seem to be alarmed, but he is looking around.
The scribe thinks they bought a bag of yellow skittles by mistake, because god damn. Seven yellow, two orange, in one handful. WTF is happening.
Aleya and Ganraz advance, but give the fallen gryphon plenty of space. Gareth and Vilgrim approach because they're good with animals. Brande is sort of approaching too but I've lost the geography of exactly where he is now. He's approaching though.
Vilgrim determines that the creature in the middle of the road is not a bird. He knows birds, and this ain't it.
Being closer now, Aleya recognises it a little. She's seen pictures of creatures like this before being used as flying cavalry. So she knows that this is very dangerous.
Vilgrim continues to approach and can see several serious wounds on it. It is most definitely dead.
Aleya investigates. It looks like the gryphon dropped from the sky and skidded a little. It wasn't placed here by anyone. Jen rejoins them, easily bounding over the rocks. He has lupine features (he's a worgen) and sniffs the gryphon. It's about 2 days old. Jhen asks Gareth if he knows anything. Gareth rolls a 3 so he just knows it's a big fuck off dog and it's dead.
As Seamus and Angelo wait near the front of the caravan. They can easily see that the group ahead are not dead yet. The wizened old man pops his head out of the caravan, and tells them that they really must be getting on now. Angelo and Seamus agree. Seamus tells him that he's welcome to go and help if he likes. Angelo lets him know that they aren't dead so it's probably safe. The old man says that his adventuring days are over.
Aleya begins heading back. Gareth and Ganraz scout ahead. They spot a flock of crows, and one big vulture. Vilgrim investigates the body of the gryphon, getting out his notebook.
Ganraz questions the fact that carrion weren't on the body before we got there. Gareth confirms it's suspicious. They wonder if this adds to Aleya's suspicion of it being a trap.
Marcos joins Angelo and Seamus, and says it's a blockage. Gets a guy called Jast to convince Angelo and Seamus. Seamus says he wants to stay back, but Marcos says he'll give him a slap if he doesn't obey his orders.
Jast, Angelo and Seamus are impressed by the beastie's size. Angelo notices that Vilgrim's got his book out, warns the others that they'll be here all day. They all roll strength checks, but somehow the bard, the 72 year old artificer and Jast are the only ones who succeed. So they're the ones doing most of the work. Gareth had hold of the tail, and as he pulled the structural damage tears the gryphon apart. The acrid smell makes some of the group retch. Disgusting.
We return to the caravan. We're all a bit suspicious of that gryphon, especially as if it's a big beast that killed it, we could be in trouble later. Ganraz goes to the back of the caravan to check on Elaine and the children. The kids are asleep, but Elaine talks to him briefly about the gryphon. Seamus returns to them, and shares some stories with Ganraz.
Aleya seeks out Vilgrim, asking about the notes he was taking. She asks about how much he knows about gryphons, and what might have killed it. Vilgrim says that he really doesn't know what might have killed it. She wants to know if there were any man-made wounds on it. Vilgrim says that there were pierce marks on it, and maybe some tears on it. It didn't look like there'd been too much damage on it from feeding etc. Aleya notices Jastiz, asks about him.
Vilgrim can talk to animals, so he can hear Jastiz call all of us strange. Aleya gets the impression that the bird is looking at her funny.
Brande rolled two horrible perception checks, so all he can think about is how bad the gryphon smelled and how his feet are hurting.
Angelo does a bit better, and hears a message in his head, telling him to go up to the front of the carriage. He can reply to this message. He goes up to the front, and the elderly man from before introduces himself as Itaan Netanis? House Crystol? He serves Lady Elise who is with him. Family famous for making illusionary dyes. She's 14, dressed in the blue and gold of her house. Wrapped in a shawl, which is covered in what looks like emeralds, but they blink like stars.
He has heard that Angelo is quite eloquent and asks for his assistance in potential negotiations. Despite his player not feeling up to it, as they aren't very eloquent, Angelo would be pleased to be of help.
We set up camp for the night, and figure out who's going to take what watch.

{[h]In camp}
Seamus and Brande are in the first watch. Brande is staring into the fire, despite supposed to be on lookout. Seamus, however, is keeping an eye on the forest, and sees various trees, rocks, and he hears the occasional animal noise. About an hour in, he's making slight adjustments to his arm, and he notices a shape in the distance. He hears a strange noise, and what looks like maybe a large bird lands in the trees. It seems to be flying from tree to tree. It's not coming towards them, it's just moving around. It sits there for a bit, and he's not sure if it's watching him, but then it flies away.
Seamus warns Angelo and Aleya on the next watch. He saw a big bird, so they should keep an eye out for that.
Aleya: You saw a bird. In a tree.
She seems unimpressed.
Angelo and Aleya's watch is mostly uneventful, until Aleya decides to investigate the forest a bit more. She sees a vulture hanging out, and shoots a ray of frost at it. Angelo jumps up, surprised, and asks what the hell she's shooting at. She tells him it's for caution. They bicker for a bit about the necessity of shooting magic into the woods in the middle of the night, and then they see a large silhouette in the trees.
Angelo: Aleya dear, did you see that as well?
Aleya: Yes. Get Ganraz. Now.
Angelo wakes Ganraz, they both fill him in. Ganraz bellows and wakes the whole camp. As he does so, they hear something crashing through the forest towards them.
Angelo: Well that's a big bloody bird.
A huge hulking green creature charges into the clearing, accompanied by five wolves with goblin riders, one dismounted goblin, and the vulture transforms into a strange hooded figure. Uh oh.

{[h]First combat of the campaign}
Seamus is up first, and he's woken up to utter chaos. He looks around for Elaine, Tresa and Myrel, and then burns a spell slot to charge his arm. He charges forwards, making sure his group are safe.
The goblins go next. Goblin A shoots at Seamus, but misses.
Goblin B charges at one of the human guards, slicing at him as he rides past.
Goblin C shoots at Angelo, but misses.
Goblin D charges at Aleya, dealing 8 points of damage.
Goblin E shoots at Ganraz but misses.
Dismounted/armoured Goblin dashes at Angelo, his warg comes with him.
The hooded figure slinks towards Seamus. He casts some spooky spell and deals psychic damage to Seamus, making him run away.
The giant green figure is actually a troll, and it stomps forwards. It swipes the injured human guard, yeeting him backwards into the campfire.
Vilgrim sneaks forwards, hiding behind a tent and shooting at the goblin about to attack Aleya. He deals 14 damage and kills it instantly.
Angelo is engaged by three things, including a hulking troll that just bit him. He disengages, gasping "It fucking bit me" in utter disbelief. As he turns, the troll swats at him, tearing part of his side cape, which is annoying. He then gives bardic inspiration to Aleya. "Aleya, darling, kill that thing for me, this was expensive."
Brandu darts forwards, casting Burning Hands on the troll. He deals 6 damage.
Ganraz uses Commander's Strike.
Aleya slashes with her sword, dealing 15 damage to the warg in front of her. There's a sizzle of blood as its head falls from its body. Definitely dead.
Seamus returns, casting firebolt at Goblin B, but it narrowly misses.
Another goblin attacks Aleya, but she manages to deflect it with her shield.
Another attacks Ganraz, dealing 10 damage.
The troll attack Ganraz but misses with both attacks. Frustrated, it backhands the guard next to Dio Brando.
Vilgrim shoots at another goblin rider, picking it off of the warg easily and killing it instantly with 14 damage. That sneak attack is crazy. He also shoots at the troll, dealing 8 points.
Elaine, who is heavily pregnant, charges into camp to get the children. She's a bloody hero.
Angelo, seeing Ganraz taking damage and knowing that if he dies, Angelo will probably die next, he casts Healing Word on the half orc and gives him 7hp back.
Brandu-chan is next, dealing 7(?) slashing damage.
Ganraz uses Manoeuvring Strike. He deals 13 damage. He then shouts to Aleya to go after the armoured goblin. She muscles her way past the troll, charging towards the armoured goblin behind it. Ganraz then deals 11 damage to the troll, and now it looks quite hurt. He then uses Manoeuvring Strike on Bran too and he manages to dart around the warg rider nearby.
Aleya deals 12 damage to the armoured goblin, using Booming Blade. She then casts Thunderwave on the area, and the goblin and the warg are killed immediately.
Seamus uses firebolt again, dealing 12 points of fire damage. It's blown off of the warg's back.
The hooded figure turns back into its vulture form and books it.
Riderless wargs start running when the realise they're losing this fight.
The troll launches another assault on Ganraz, but he's a strong boi and is holding back each blow with his shield.
Vilgrim shoots at the troll whilst it's distracted by Ganraz. The arrow lodges beneath its collarbone, dealing 15 damage.
Angelo casts Healing Word on himself, giving himself 4hp back, and then runs and slides into cover behind where Vilgrim is. Vilgrim is trying to be the night, so he's not pleased that the bard is seeking refuge in his blind spot.
Brans takes 7 and then 6 damage from the goblin and the warg near him. He then deals 12 points of piercing damage to the vulture as it flees, but although it's wounded it's not going down. He hurries to the treeline, trying to keep it within sight.
Ganraz manoeuvres around the troll and takes a swing at the troll. His blade scrapes the side without damaging it.
Aleya charges after the armoured goblin and his warg and uses Booming Blade on the warg. She deals 10 damage, obliterating the warg. The rider is prone. She lowers her sword, pointing the tip at the goblin's neck, and tells him "Stay the fuck down." Damn Aleya, you scary.
Seamus moves towards the goblin closest to him, dealing 16 damage with his flaming axe. The goblin is thrown well off of his warg, spiralling through the air in a very dead mess.
The goblin close to Ganraz, as does his warg, but both miss.
The warg by Seamus tried to run, so Seamus got an attack of opportunity, dealing 13 damage and killing it.
The armoured goblin, despite Aleya's strict instructions, manages to get up, disengage, and run off into the forest.
The troll claws at Ganraz, dealing 12 damage, and though the second misses, he takes 12 damage from the third attack.
Vilgrim remembers he's a smol boi, and realises he can't just walk over there. However, he can dash, so he sprints over to where the troll is. He draws his rapier, slashing at it and dealing 17 damage. His blade goes through its thigh and pulls back. Green blood spills everywhere. It looks pretty bad.
Angelo is really tired of this shit now, and casts Vicious Mockery on the troll mostly by accident. Sort of like a reflex. (DM kindly reminded the player that they could cast it, and their response was "I don't know how to use it and I'm too tired to care now". The party decided this counted) He deals 4 psychic damage to the troll. He then, grumbling all the time, casts Healing Word on Ganraz again, unable to believe that he's having to use his magic. Ganraz regains 8 hp.
Brande fires an arrow at the goblin, but it misses. He moves away to a safe distance.
Ganraz is looking pretty rough.
Vilgrim lashes out with his rapier, slashing a V into its chest, before stabbing it upwards through the head and sending it crashing to the ground. First boss kill of the campaign, ya boi Vilgrim's got this.
Aleya shoots a Ray of Frost at the fleeing goblin's legs. It deals 8 damage, and the goblin drops.

{[h]End of battle/session}
Seamus rushes to check on Elaine and the kids. Others go to help Aleya get the goblin she caught. Markos comes running in, and despite a slight cut on his forehead he looks fine. Jast also appears to be fine. He yells that Lady Elise has gone missing, taken by some of the raiding goblins.
And that's where we end the session.
We level up. No, for real. We're level 4 now.`

`{[h]At the camp}
We're only a day and a half away from the Elsyr Vale. After a raid by a party of goblins and a troll, we take a moment to reflect on how the battle went and the knowledge that Lady Elise is gone.
Markos asks Ganraz what the hell happened. Ganraz gives a quick recap of our situation, and Markos sends Jast and some men to scout the treeline. Aleya approaches, dragging the unconscious goblin behind her. She checks in on Ganraz, and Brande is also pretty beaten up. Seamus and Ganraz check in on Elaine and the kids. They're ok, just a bit shaken up.
Markos says we did better than they did; half of their guard got split up, many of them dead, and he and Jast had to fight their way out of a corner. He reckons we put up more of a fight than the goblins anticipated. Markos is also surprised that the goblins have raided a caravan as big as ours. Aleya says we'll learn more when our goblin guest wakes up. Markos tells us that he saw them targeting girls in particular, and Aleya finds it curious how specific their target it.
Vilgrim knows that a (now officially recognised) nation of goblins lead by a guy called Haruk (?) were hired as a fighting force for Cyre, and then claimed all of the land. Angelo rolled badly, so he accidentally doesn't know this. (An omen from the dice gods?)
Brande tries to kick the goblin awake. It's ineffective. Now that we can see him better, we can see he's wearing a helmet that obscures the face, and his armour is a patchwork of leather and dark green plate. He's got quite a large wound in his leg. Seamus goes for a medicine roll; it's a 5. Definitely an omen from the dice gods.
Aleya removes its helmet and buckler. There is a fairly large tattoo on his neck. Through her search, she discovers a direwolf fang on his belt, with something carved into it. He's got 5 gold pieces and 5 silver, most of them seeming half chewed. He also seems to have a feather pendant. She removes all of these, and gives the direwolf fang to Ganraz because she can't read goblin.
Ganraz can and translates it roughly to "alpha".
Jen and Robin enter. She looks a little less cheerful than she normally does, and hurries to where Jast is. Jen hurries over to Markos, and says he will try to check for traps etc. Jen then joins Jast and the others, as does Brande.
Ganraz grabs a tankard of water, pouring it over the goblin's face. He comes to. His right eye is ruined, but his left eye is pale and milky. He does appear to be looking at us though. Ganraz asks him to make this easy. The goblin says he would not prefer death, but he doubts that Ganraz can help. Ganraz gets a 19 on his intimidation roll. Apparently, the goblins were sent by The Outcast, named Kar'vun (apparently he's a hobgoblin). He points at his eye, and then the tattoo on his neck, and says that The Outcast did this to him. The plan was to take any one of the girls in our caravan who might be young or pure. "He seeks a great prize in the mountains." Ganraz then asks where Lady Elise has been taken. Goblin tells us it's maybe a half day's ride, past the soldier's leg, there is a tomb.
Angelo rolls high on an insight check, and notices that the goblin keeps touching his tattoo, almost like a tick. He makes a note of this in his little black book. For now he remains quiet and unnoticed.
The goblin tells Ganraz that he was against Kar'vun, and so The Outcast killed him. Ganraz asks what that means, but then switches back to common to tell us what happened. The goblin then tells us that the mark is his link to The Outcast. Ganraz then says that we can no longer speak in front of him.
The goblin sits up and says he will help us. He then draws us a map in the dirt. It leads to Tulin's Seat, which is a name Aleya and Angelo recognise. Before he can tell us any more, his hand snaps away from his neck, and his eye flashes purple. Aleya draws her sword, suspicious. The goblin's eye then turns back again, and he starts to say 'Hel—' before she cuts his head off.
Aleya and Markos make a plan; the caravan should hurry to the next stop, whilst we go after Lady Elise.
The rest of the caravan is packing up getting ready to move. Vilgrim manages to get away from the group, and sends a message. Sneaky boi.
Angelo rolls a history check, and knows that Tulin's Seat is a local name for that particular peak. He remembers something about it being named after a dwarf. The other place that the scribe can't spell, he has no idea about.
Jen asks if we need his services, but as Vilgrim, Ganraz and Angelo have drawn up the map, and Brande has a good track on the vulture.
Angelo finishes writing notes in his black book, and sees Vilgrim near to him. He snaps it shut, tucking it back into his tunic. Vilgrim squints at him.
Itaan, Elise's aide, is bandaged heavily. He's unconscious, and apparently fought hard to keep Elise safe. He'll probably be ok, Seamus saw to that.

{[h]Let's hunt some goblin}
Seamus remains behind to guard the children.
Brande and Ganraz are leading, as they're the best trackers. Following them is Gareth, and Angelo and Vilgrim make up the middle ranks, with Aleya bringing up the rear.
Brande and Ganraz both roll survival; Brande 11 and Ganraz 7. Ganraz is starting to get a bit confused due to his concussion, but Brande can see the tracks just fine. Brande and Gareth roll perception. They can tell that most of the animals have been scared off, seeming quiet because of the troll crashing through the tree.
Brande and Ganraz roll again, B 11 G 15. They get more of an idea that there are double the tracks coming in our direction than are going back. The raiding party clearly suffered many losses.
We reach a lake between two mountains. There's no trees anymore, it's just slopes and short grass, with lots of rock. Not much cover. We can see in the distance that there is a statue; it's the soldier that Ganraz told us about.
Brande asks if we're likely to encounter traps. Aleya confirms this.
Angelo asks Vilgrim where Jastiz is. He tells the half elf that he left his bird back with the caravan. "Well, there goes my idea." But Gareth cottons onto what Angelo was going to suggest, and turns into a rabbit to go and investigate ahead.
He can see there's a lot of rubble in front of the statue, and a large sword lies in it (made of the same stone). It's dressed in what looks like plate armour. He can't tell what creature it might be, he can only see legs. He can't read the plaque either, because it's in goblin.
Whilst we're waiting, Ganraz turns to Vilgrim and asks what he used to do. Vilgrim tells him that he used to travel the world and document the different species. He was also fought a bit during the war. He rolls an 18 on his deception, whilst Ganraz does not roll well. It makes sense that Vilgrim would be good at fighting, lots of people were caught up in the war.
Brande checks the area; there is a low mist, but judging from what he can tell, our enemies will have advantage if we approach, because we have no cover. The mist is starting to clear a bit because the morning is wearing on.
Aleya ritual casts Detect Magic. She can detect a faint sense of divination from Vilgrim, faint enchantment from Angelo, and faint abjuration from Brande.
Gareth returns, and tells us that there's nothing threatening to bunny rabbits over there. So it's probably safe.
We choose speed over stealth, breaking cover and making our way over to the statue. As we get as close as Gareth got, Ganraz can read the plaque. It's in very ancient goblin, "This land is his. This is his vigil." Gareth can tell that the statue is artfully done, but although it's similar to dwarvish style it wasn't made by his dwarf bois.
Aleya's Detect Magic can only detect very faint traces of abjuration, but her ritual spell is almost at its end. It's more like an aftertaste of magic.
We continue on after investigating the statue. Ganraz and Brande roll 16 and 15 on their survival checks respectively. They can follow the trails where some of the wargs and the goblin have passed over the stone. We all roll a perception check, and at least half of us roll pretty well. We've climbed up to where the waterfall is, and as we start to crest up a ridge, those of us who rolled high spot some loose rocks fall ahead of us. We're still climbing, and have to go up to where that scree slope is. There aren't any big rocks, just some small ones.
Nobody really fancies taking the scree slope of death, so we continue on the path.
Brande and Ganraz roll another survival, but they're starting to lose the tracks. It's a lot of loose rock, so there's not much to leave tracks on. The vague path we've been following ends, and we discover a scree slope which seems like a false peak.
Vilgrim, being the lightest, scrambles up the scree slope (but stealthily). He makes pretty decent progress, and through his scouting he has a pretty good idea of where to guide us to go. He decides to climb up to the ridge and guide them from there (but stealthily). When he reaches the top, he sees a lot of loose rubble and a small entrance in the rocks. It looks like a lot of rock has been shifted from within and moved out to the sides of it. There is the remains of a fire that looks like it's recently been put out.
As he's climbing down to guide us up, he slips a little bit. Thinking quickly, he casts minor illusion to disguise the sound of falling rock with birds. It's pretty convincing.
The rest of the party join him. Pretty much everyone rolls well, except for Ganraz who gets a 1. His heavy armour clinks against the rocks, and we all wait with bated breath. Gareth rolls the highest perception, and can hear hushed whispers.
Brande reaches the top first, but despite getting a 16 on his stealth check, a volley of arrows comes sailing over the ridge.

{[h]Oh shit oh fuck}
Initiative order: Vilgrim, Gareth, Brande, Ganraz, Aleya, Angelo.
Vilgrim gets low, darting to his left and taking cover behind the ridge where the goblins are. He's a pretty stealthy boi. He's safe in cover. He prepares to scramble up.
Gareth moves to the right, taking cover behind a large rock, and casts Entangle on the three archer goblins at the top of the ridge. Two of them are restrained.
Brande charges forwards. He can see that they are armed with spears. He can't really tell if the vulture goblin has healed from last time. He then uses his Planar Warrior ability. Orange glow begins to spread from Brande's hand, and as he draws and notches an arrow, we hear a crackling sound. He marks the blue goblin, loosing this translucent, crackling arrow and dealing 14 force damage. Its chest just implodes, and he's launched backwards. He then backs up.
Five of the goblins move up to the edge, and hold their action. Two more archers appear at the top. They shoot at Ganraz, Gareth and Brande. Gareth is missed, but one arrow strikes Ganraz, dealing 7 piercing damage. Another arrow hits Brande, dealing 5 damage.
The vulture goblin steps forwards, raising his hands, and both Brande and Ganraz feel shadows beginning to clutch at their chests. They both manage to shrug off the Bane that he was trying to cast on them. Ganraz flexes and shrugs off the shadows, whilst a heat shimmer around Brande fends it off.
The wargs run and jump over the top of the goblins, trying to attack Ganraz and Brande. The warg attacking Brande misses, but the one attacking Ganraz deals 9 damage. It tries to wrestle him to the ground, but fails to do so because of Ganraz's impressive muscles.
Ganraz charges past the warg, rushing the goblins. Green and orange goblins try to hit Ganraz, because they readied their actions, but both miss.
Aleya sprints forwards, slashing at the orange goblin, and deals 15 damage. It crumbles to the ground, dead.
Angelo steps forwards, and sees the vulture goblin. He surmises that it's the biggest threat, considering the damage it can do, so he casts Vicious Mockery on it. "You, sir, are the reason mind flayers starve to death." It takes 4 psychic damage, and has disadvantage on its next roll. He then draws his rapier in preparation for what may come next.
From within the darkness stomps what appears to be an ogre. Shitu.
Vilgrim climbs up the ridge; none of the goblins have noticed him, so he shoots at the vulture goblin. He deals 20 damage, and then scrabbles back down the ridge to bonus action hide.
Gareth drops his entangle spell, turning his hands and willing a sphere of flame on the orange and green archers. It deals 11 points of damage to both of them, instantly incinerating them. He then bowls it to the right, the flames slamming into the purple archer and knocking it off the cliff with 8 points of damage. It's also very dead.
Brande casts Burning Hands in a cone of flame; the red goblin sees Brande in time and takes half damage, but green goblin takes 9 damage and dies a screaming death.
The ogre brings his weapon down onto Ganraz, but he dodges and it crashes into the stone next to him. The second attack rings against Ganraz's shield, but doesn't hit him.
The vulture boi runs for the entrance, and tries to cast Dissonant Whispers on Aleya, but she's not having any of that shit.
The red goblin tries to grapple Ganraz, but basically bounces off of him.
The purple and pink goblins try to attack Aleya.
The red and blue archers panic shoot at Gareth. One of them hits, and he loses concentration on his spell.
One of the wargs tries to attack Brande, whilst the other goes after Ganraz. The one attacking Brande misses, and the warg attacking Ganraz tries to maul him but once again bounces off him.
Ganraz commands Vilgrim to kill the vulture goblin. The gnome was waiting for the order; he darts forwards, dealing 12 damage. His arrow goes all the way through his back, and the hood tumbles, revealing a very ugly goblin. It's very dead. Ganraz's turn continues (wait there's more!), but his attack seems to slide off its armour. The warg at his back isn't helping matters.
Aleya uses her flame blade on the ogre, but it misses.
Angelo sees that red goblin has taken a lot of damage, so he casts Vicious Mockery on it. As it's watching its companions perish in fire, it spots a half elven man in the midst of the chaos. Angelo looks at him and says "I was expecting someone taller," dealing 4 psychic damage. It begin to cry blood and collapses, dead. The bard just killed someone. Holy shit. He then notices that Aleya has taken some damage too, so he casts Healing Word on her, giving her 7hp back.
Vilgrim tries to shoot at the ogre, but just misses. He takes a chance, bonus action hiding before anyone notices where the shot came from.
Gareth casts another flaming sphere, dropping it onto the ogre and the purple goblin. It kills the goblin instantly, dealing 7 damage, but the 7 damage didn't seem to phase the ogre; it's on fire, and doesn't currently seem bothered.
Brande shoots at the ogre, but it misses.
The pink goblin tries to attack Aleya, but misses.
The two archers try to shoot at Aleya and Angelo. They both hit, taking damage. Angelo could have burned a bardic inspiration, but he decided to save it and take it like a twink.
The warg wrestles Ganraz to the ground, dealing 6 damage.
The warg attacking Brande manages to deal 12 damage. Brande uses Hellish Rebuke, dealing 18 points of fire damage. The warg basically shrivels from the heat and dies.
The ogre moves to its left, dealing 12 points of damage to Ganraz, and then attacks Aleya twice. She manages to get her shield up, and deflects the damage. The ogre takes 7 damage at the end of his turn (courtesy of Gareth's flaming sphere.
Ganraz decides to not pull too much against the warg, trying to minimise damage, and orders Vilgrim to shoot at the warg. Vilgrim deals 15 damage, but it's still hanging in there.
Aleya slashes at an exposed bit of leg, dealing 10 damage. She action surges, attacking the warg. (She doesn't need to roll here because it's gonna be dead, so I'll say she gets another 10 for the purpose of counting up).
Angelo sees this horrifying display of mauling from the warg, and casts Healing Word on Ganraz, giving him 7hp back. He then tries to cast Vicious Mockery on the ogre, but is just so disgusted by the creature that he can't think of anything clever to say.
Vilgrim is tired of firing from the shadows, dealing 14 damage with his rapier. Its leg is now dragging, basically severed after being attacked by both Aleya and Vilgrim. The ogre uses its reaction to use Looming Presence, and Vilgrim is now frightened. He disengages, running back.
Gareth maintains his bowling ball of doom.
Brande moves past the frightened gnome and the ogre, taking a shot at the red archer on the ridge. He deals 11 force damage, shooting him straight in the head and snapping backwards. He's definitely dead.
The last blue archer rolls a morale check, and not surprisingly he runs the fuck away.
The ogre deals two attacks to Aleya and Ganraz. It gets a nat 20 on Aleya, and she is down. It takes damage from Gareth's fire bowling ball.
Ganraz steps to the side, putting himself between the ogre and Aleya, and swings at him. He deals 9 slashing damage.
Aleya's making death saving throws. That's an oof, yikes, Scoob.
Angelo sees this, and he rushes forwards. He grabs Aleya under the arms, dragging her backwards out of harm's way, and casts second level Healing Word on her. She regains 9hp, no longer in danger of dying, phew.
Vilgrim makes it back behind the rocks, taking a very shaky shot at the ogre. It misses due to his fear.
Brande slashes at the ogre, dealing 11 force damage. His scimitar is blazing with orange light.
The ogre slashes at Ganraz. Its first attack misses, but the second deals 12 damage.
Ganraz isn't gonna take any of that shit. He 11 damage. He casts his shield aside, leaping up and plunging his sword through the creature's chest. Its knee physically buckles because of the damage to the leg. Ganraz keeps forcing it down, and when he lets go, the creature is dead, stationary. Locked in this position by Ganraz's sword.
NOTE TO PLAYERS: Loot fucking everything.
We can now investigate the door, and Ganraz sees an ancient goblin plaque. It roughly translates as "This ground is his. Grovel to him." Usakvaal's Rest.`

`{[h]Post-battle recap}
Lady Elise has been taken by goblins. We hurried to follow. Got ambushed. Shit. We were doing ok until an undead ogre got into the mix, then we had some trouble. Aleya got injured, quite badly, but we did kill the ogre and the vulture goblin.

{[h]We all assess the damage}
Aleya is feeling like shit. Her ribs aren't broken, thanks to Angelo's magical healing, but she's in a lot of pain. She asks if we can stop for like 5, 10 minutes just to catch our breaths.
Gareth casts cure wounds on Aleya, giving her 15hp. He then casts Cure Wounds on Ganraz, giving him 8hp. He gives Ganraz another 10hp with a second cast. He then uses his last wildshape to transform into a wolf. He then pads off, making sure that we're not flanked by any wargs that might appear. Angelo casts Healing Word on himself, giving himself 8hp back.
Vilgrim investigates the vulture goblin. He gets an 18; the goblin has milky white eyes, and it smells of rot rather than the acrid smell from before. He feels warm, instead of cold like the alpha goblin. He's got a pendant, which appears to be a humanoid molar tied on a cord. He's also carrying 20 gold and 10 silver. He's also got various pouches of weird witchy shit, which Vilgrim doesn't have any idea about. On one of his fingers, he's wearing a brass ring, with red engravings on it that form a wave pattern. Vilgrim slips this into his pocket.
Brande and Angelo have a look at the ogre. We kick it over onto the floor; looking at the armour, it's clearly torn up, and it's too big for any of us to wear regardless. The blades are large, meat cleaver looking things, very rusty. Taking the helmet off, we can see there's a large tattoo on its neck. It's the exact same as the alpha goblin's. The ogre is cold to the touch.
Ganraz moves toward the entrance, looking for tracks etc. He can see that it goes about 15ft in, and just at the edge of his dark vision he can make out what looks like a large, cuboid raised section.
Aleya finishes ritual casting Detect Magic, and senses necromancy from the ogre, and restoration from the direction of the vulture goblin. She also gets a strong sense of abjuration from something behind the rocks around the entrance, as in there's a lot of it, probably in various places. She warns Ganraz, telling him that she can sense a magical presence, and although she can't tell whether it was designed to keep something out or in. She does know it's something protective in nature.
It's time to move in. Ganraz lays down the battle plan; stick together, don't fuck around, and if we find Elise, we should consider other options from just attacking. Aleya also suggests that Brande watch our backs, to make sure we don't get flanked.
Walking order: Ganraz, Aleya, Vilgrim, Angelo, Brande.
Brande, to Angelo: Don't worry, I'll keep you safe.
Angelo: I appreciate the sentiment, dear.

{[h]In the cave}
As Ganraz reaches the edge of the raised dais, torches light themselves. On the back wall, we see a mural depicting a battle. The battle seems to be centred around the lake, whilst hobgoblins hold the ridge against a many-eyed creature that seems to be from the depths of hell. Great.
One figure stands directly in front of the creature, wearing armour.
Angelo isn't comforted by the mural. Aleya's Detect Magic is still going.
[Scribe Note: Missed a big chunk of lore about the mural here, because I was grabbing my dinner. I'm a failure of a scribe]
Aleya tells us that this place we have found is very old. She asks if anyone knows about the hobgoblin empire or stories. Angelo remembers the story vaguely, but he doesn't have any more information beyond what everyone in the group already knows.
Ganraz checks the door that's slightly ajar, but he can't hear anything within. There is a slight breeze going past him, but that's all.
Aleya checks the other door, and finds it's unlocked. She asks which way they want to go. Ganraz suggests we take the smaller door first.
Vilgrim investigates the dais, and he can see that it's an altar of some sort. But then he rolled a 5 with his blighted dice, so he can basically just see what the rest of us can see. There's some urns, some cloth, but no blood, so that's nice.
We're trying the door on the left. Aleya tries to open it quietly, but it's very heavy and scrapes a little bit. The hinges aren't rusted though.
Aleya and Ganraz decide to advance. They draw their swords, checking out the corridor behind the door. The corridor doesn't look as polished and well-preserved as the previous area.
Whilst they're exploring, Brande checks the other door, but rolls a perception of 8. Soooo that could go either way, really.
Back with Ganraz, he's checking out the three doors he's just found. He finds a room with the ruined frames of what appeared to have once been beds.
[Scribe note: Not going to write all of the investigation here, because I'm eating dinner. If it's relevant to plot, I'll add it, but typing and eating is hard. Suffice to say, Ganraz and Aleya are investigating rooms and they're still alive.]
The Dream Team speculate about the purpose of this place; if it's a shrine of some sort, then it doesn't seem to have been used recently. They poke through various crates, but only one contains something of interest. Aleya finds a pouch that smells kind of powdery, like incense. She has some knowledge of components for spells, so she believes that this incense may have magical applications. She doesn't know what to do with it, but she decides to hang onto it.
Meanwhile, Angelo and Vilgrim are both snacking now, but Angelo has the time to appreciate the mural and the room as a whole, being one who likes art and stories and stuff. He can enjoy this place as a root of a story. Vilgrim is horrified by the pictures.
He takes a moment to look at the ring he's found. He can't tell any more than he already did, so he shows it to Angelo, asking what it might be. Angelo doesn't know, because he can't Detect Magic or anything, but he can see it's pretty. Vilgrim considers putting it on, and Angelo stops him, asking him where he got it from. Vilgrim admits he got it from the vulture goblin. Angelo thinks that that's a terrible idea. Brande overhears this, and agrees that items from a vulture goblin in league with a necromancer. They bicker a little over the risk-reward.
Ganraz's attempt to pick the lock on the door doesn't work, so he does the next best thing – He kicks the shit out of it. Aleya helps.
They discover a room with a nice, well-preserved desk. Ganraz assesses it to be a priest's quarters, maybe. Aleya agrees, and Ganraz searches the desk. The right-hand draw doesn't have anything special in it. In the next one, there's a false bottom to the draw. Inside is a piece of paper with legible markings. There's also a circular brass pendant, with six rubies in it. There's also a dark, leather bag.
As he retrieves these things, Ganraz looks to his right and sees a figure in faint, ethereal blue. It looks at him, tilts its head, and then fades backwards through the wall. Piss off, ghost.
It scares the shit out of Ganraz and Aleya, and their surprised yells draws the attention of Brande, Angelo and Vilgrim. Brande rushes to them, but Angelo and Vilgrim hang back, waiting to see whether people are dead or not.
Ganraz tells Brande there's ghosts, sounding a bit panicky, and Aleya tells him they've fought worse than ghosts before. It's a lie.
They discover that the piece of paper Ganraz found earlier is actually a thin piece of rock, and he translates it aloud to Aleya and Brande.
Angelo peeks around the corner, checking to see if everyone's still alive. Brande tells him there's ghosts. Angelo is not thrilled by the news. Ganraz relays the information on the tablet to the others, and Angelo recognises the word Ja'shaarat – it's the original name for the hobgoblin capital, got ruined, then became Sharn.
We all regroup in the chamber, and Vilgrim decides to at last put his ring on. We all think it's a terrible idea, but he's doing it. Nothing seems to happen, aside from a fluttering in his gut and the need to run, which only lasts a second. We're all suspicious nonetheless, and Ganraz warns Vilgrim that if that ring means he's going to get haunted by a hobgoblin ghost from now on, he won't be pleased.
Ganraz and Aleya haul the other door open, and we see a long corridor, stretching out to a staircase at the end. There's an eight foot statue in front of us. Ganraz looks around, and can see that there's been some dust disturbed. Angelo rolls a bit higher on his investigation, and notices that the floor is worn. Vilgrim suggests that it might be a place for praying.
Angelo slowly and awkwardly kneels before the statue, not sure how much he trusts this situation and a bit embarrassed in front of the others. Nothing seems to happen. Ganraz kneels next to him, putting some gems on the base of the statue. Still nothing.
Angelo, whispering: Ganraz, if a ghost pops out, there's no shame in running, is there?
Ganraz, also whispering: No, definitely not.
Angelo: Excellent, we're in this together.
Ganraz gets up, and tries walking down the corridor. His vision blurs for a moment, and the walls seem to shimmer, but nothing happens to him. Seeing this, Angelo also creeps past the first pillars, and nothing happens to him. They both reach the end of the corridor. Aleya follows, saluting the statue first, and nothing happens to her. Seeing their companions are all right, Vilgrim and Brande also kneel before the statue before following. Nothing happens to them either, although Brande sees demonic shapes with teeth somewhere behind him. So that's fun.
We all reach the stairs at the end of the corridor.

{[hi]We descend}
Walking order: Ganraz, Aleya, Angelo, Vilgrim, Brande
Ganraz creeps round the corner, and sees that it's going to open out into a chamber. He turns back to the party, and puts a finger to his lips. Ooooh, we stealthin' bois. Ganraz 16. Brande 22. Angelo 20. Vilgrim 27. Aleya 4.
Ganraz sneaks forwards because he's feeling stealthy today, and peers into the room. The room appears to be full of statues. There's no inscriptions of names, but they are impressive. Some bear swords, some have details like circlets etc, and all are lifesize. The room is cold.
Vilgrim takes a big ol sniff, and can't smell the same rot from before. The flame, despite what is normal for fire, doesn't seem to smell of anything either, no crackling wood or anything.
As they near the other door, Angelo hears voices whispering ahead of them. He hurries forwards and stops Ganraz from continuing, warning him of the voices. He then suggests that he could perhaps turn one of the party invisible, if we wanted to stealth ahead. The group agree it's a good idea, so Angelo sizes up Vilgrim, and then clicks his fingers. The gnome is now invisible.
Vilgrim sneaks ahead whilst the party waits behind. He finds another room with an even larger undead ogre in it. Behind him are two more figures, one in a cage and one standing beside a sarcophagus. Lady Elise is in the cage, apparently unconscious. The other figure is scribbling on the ground, muttering in a language Vilgrim doesn't know.
Vilgrim weighs his choices. He sneaks back, placing his hand carefully in Ganraz's to alert him of his presence. He tells Ganraz what's up, then sneaks back into the chamber to sneak attack the necromancer.
He stops behind the necromancer, holding his rapier, and stabs sharply, dealing 26 damage. It would have pierced the heart, but the shadows swirling around the necromancer shift him slightly at the last moment. As his invisibility spell drops, Vilgrim yells, "NOW!"

{h]Roll initiative}
Turn order: Aleya, Brande, Vilgrim, Angelo, Ganraz
Aleya dashes past the ogre. It tries to take an attack of opportunity, and it has sentinel, but it rolls a nat 1 so that's perfect. She rushes at the necromancer, dealing 7 slashing damage and 6 fire damage. He's looking pretty pissed off.
Brande, seeing this big beastie, decides to do the smart thing and avoid him. He tries to shoot at the necromancer, but his arrow gets eaten up by the shadows.
The necromancer glares at Aleya, snarling, "You dare try to disturb my work?" He uses Shadow Blast, dealing 10 damage to Aleya and knocking her back 15 feet.
It's the ogre's turn. Oh shit oh fuck. It tries to attack Aleya, but 16 doesn't hit, so fuck yes.
Vilgrim aims at the eye socket of the ogre, dealing 17 damage, but it doesn't seem to react except.
A cloud of daggers flies from Angelo's palm, swirling in between the ogre and Aleya. It deals 10 damage, leaving nicks and cuts across its skin. He then casts Bardic Inspiration on Aleya, inspiring her to get the fuck back up.
Ganraz charges forwards, slashing at the necromancer, but the shadows force him backwards.
Aleya slips past the ogre, slashing at the necromancer and dealing 16 damage. The ogre takes 3 fire damage. Green light carves through the shadow, and Aleya yells at Vilgrim, "Get the girl!" The ogre, with that stupid sentinel shit, gets to attack Aleya. She is on one hit point. Holy shit.
Brande is next. He glances at the cage Elise is in, and sees that it would open from the top. He yells to Vilgrim, "I've got the girl!" He gets to the cage, slashing at the lock with his scimitar. It deals 10 damage, shattering the lock.

{[h]We got a cutscene}
Kar'vun has blood dripping from beneath his robes, and shadows stream off of him. He sees Brande shatter the lock and reach for the girl. He looks back at the sarcophagus, and mutters under his breath, "It was not supposed to be like this. I need more time." He takes a step back, and Ganraz tries to attack. The necromancer casts shield. He then steps up to the sarcophagus, offering his arm as a sacrifice. Everything from the elbow down drops into the shadows.
A gauntleted hand reaches out of the sarcophagus, and a warrior in black armour rises from the darkness. Kar'vun is pleased, until that gauntleted hand catches him by the throat. Kar'vun realises, a bit too late, that this might have been a bad plan.
Milky white tendrils spill from beneath the armoured figure's armour, slamming into Kar'vun. His body shrivels, and that boi is dead.
The ogre drops when the necromancer does.

{[h]Wew lad, we're in the second stage of the boss battle}
The undead knight steps forwards, slashing at Ganraz. He parries it, but an ethereal tentacle snaps out, dealing 7 points of damage, and Ganraz is grappled.
Angelo casts Vicious Mockery on the undead knight. He says in Elvish, "I won't waste my best insults on you, because you wouldn't understand them." The sheer arrogance of that remark transcends the undead knight's comprehension, dealing 4 psychic damage. Angelo then casts Healing Word on Aleya, giving her 8hp back.
Ganraz uses Distracting Strike, knocking it off balance.
Aleya attacks, dealing 15 damage. Her blade carves through the breast plate.
Brande reaches into the cage, grabbing Elise, and pulling her out of the cage. He hurries away from the cage, towards Vilgrim.
Vilgrim puts himself between Brande and the undead knight, but his arrow glances off the armour.
The undead knight slashes at Aleya, but she casts Shield. It then tries to use Life Drain on Ganraz. Dealing 26 damage. Ganraz has one hp left, shit shit shit.
Angelo casts Vicious Mockery on the Death Knight, shouting, "Leave them alone, you son of a mongrel!" He deals 3 psychic damage, bruising the Death Knight's ego.
Ganraz commands Vilgrim to shoot now. He does so, dealing 17 damage.
Aleya slashes at the Death Knight, dealing 8 damage. She shouts at the rest of the party, "Take the girl and go!"
Brande hurries past, ordering Angelo to make sure the others get out as well.
Angelo is conflicted and, obeying Aleya's instruction first, steps to follow Brande. He stops, hisses, "fuck" and then runs back into the room, casting Healing Word on Ganraz and giving him 10 hp back. He then casts Vicious Mockery again, distracting the Death Knight by shouting, "Your mother was a goblin!" 3 psychic damage.
Ganraz manages to fight his way free of the tendrils, backing away.
Aleya's blade hums as she slashes at the Death Knight, slicing clean through its spinal column and decapitating it in one clean slice. (15 damage)

{[h]Post-battle fatigue}
Aleya crumples to one knee, asking Ganraz how he is. Ganraz doesn't answer, slumping back against the pillar and catching his breath.
Angelo approaches, and admits he's exhausted, he can't use any magic at the moment to heal either of them. He does glance at the tattered ends of his cloak, and offers to cut off some strips for them to use as bandages. They thank him but refuse.
Angelo: Ok, well, I'm not going to offer again, I'm not that nice.
Brande checks on Lady Elise, and she appears to be unhurt. She just seems to be sleeping. He gets the impression that it's an effect of magic.
Angelo inspects the Death Knight's armour. It's well-made, but it's obviously old. The sword has been treated to appear black, and Angelo finds engravings on the back of the breast plate. He discreetly pulls out his black book, drawing them in for later reference.
Ganraz gets up and limps towards the entrance.
Vilgrim inspects the body by the sarcophagus. He finds 2 potions, 5 platinum, and a large topaz. He then inspects the area, with Angelo giving advantage. He can tell that this was supposed to be Usak Vaal, and there's a slot for something. It seems strange to him.
Aleya: Help me up…
Angelo: Of course. (He does so) Would you like an arm to help you walk?
Aleya: You know what…. Feel free, why not.
Angelo: You've surprised me. Does this mean we are starting to become friends?
Aleya: I wouldn't go that far.
Angelo: Fair enough. I must warn you, this is two favours you owe me now, as this is the second time I've helped you. I will keep count.
Ganraz makes it outside, taking in a deep breath. A wolf appears, and Gareth shifts back into his normal shape. He asks what the fuck happened, and Ganraz briefly explains.
Upon Aleya's recommendation, Vilgrim runs to get the needed object from Ganraz. He runs back, putting the disc in the slot. The statue slides back, revealing a slope. Angelo says straight away that it's a terrible idea to go that way. Aleya and Vilgrim ignore him, heading off to investigate, a badly limping Aleya leading the way.
They discover what appears to be a tomb, containing 5 sarcophagi. They seem to be perfectly preserved. Aleya immediately warns Vilgrim to not touch anything. As they respectfully enter, a spectral figure appears. It's the same ghost from before.
It stands beside the hilt of a sword, and looks at Aleya. He bows his head, and she hears a voice in her head saying, "You defeated the despoilers. You may be worthy."
She turns to Vilgrim, and tells him to be ready to leave if something goes down. She then approaches the hilt, and carefully touches it. As soon as she does, she sees visions of that battle; she can see the bugbear from the statue cut down her commander, and she feels fear, and then it relaxes, calming, and she feels more in control. Vilgrim sees Aleya close her eyes, and then a blade of pure white light appears from the hilt, and the vanishes again.
Aleya opens her eyes. She's a bit shaken, not sure what to think of what just happened. But nothing bad has technically happened, so she keeps hold of the sword hilt.
We all regroup at the camp Gareth has made up, settling down for the rest of the night.
Vilgrim checks out the ring; it's an adrenaline ring, and he decides to give it to Ganraz. Unlike Angelo, Vilgrim doesn't expect any favours in return.
And that's the end of the session. We are now level 5, and we get a long rest.

`{[h]So. Last session. That happened.}
We're still in the academy.
Aleya's breastplate has been removed for better access to the wound, which seems to have been healed, but there is no life. She seems tranquil. Angelo is still kneeling beside her, but he drops the staff now. Vilgrim is cradling her head. Brande doesn't fully understand what's happening, so he uses his pearl of power to get another third level spell slot back and tries to cast Cure Wounds on her. It of course doesn't work.
Jazzir slowly stands, and reaches out a hand. His staff, which is at the bottom of the steps, shoots upwards and into his hand, and he uses it to help him down the stairs. Seamus casts Cure Wounds on him, and hears the dragonborn mutter under his breath, 'The Lioness.' He pace begins to pick up as he moves down the steps, as he gets closer Seamus hears him whisper, 'Poetry.' Then in a louder voice, he tells the others to remove the rest of her armour as there's something more he can do for her. Vilgrim and Brande rush to obey. He then reaches into a pouch, and pulls out two copper pieces, placing one on each of Aleya's eyes. As he finishes his incantation, he throws salt into the air, and ice covers Aleya's form. It's clear, we can see through it, but it is solid.
Brande asks if this is healing her. Jazzir has to explain to him that she's gone, but this spell will preserve her body. Things are happening, and it may not be time yet to say our goodbyes. [He has cast Gentle Repose on her, so there's 10 days left on it] The effort exhausts him, and he gestures for a chair to come to him. He says he needs to contact someone as he sits, and he begins to cast a spell. Angelo and Seamus roll arcana checks, getting 18 and 17 respectively. They can both tell it's not an uncommon spell, and seems to be casting Sending to someone, even though he doesn't speak. He then casts the spell again, but this time he speaks. 'I am pretty competent. I will discuss with them. Yes, I was there. I will be fine. Others are not so lucky.' Jazzir then tells us that he needs to talk to us, but will give us a few minutes whilst he messages other people to tell them of the attack.
Seamus rests his hand on Angelo's shoulder, telling him that everyone tried their best. Angelo replies that it wasn't enough, and walks off to a far corner by himself. Ganraz sheaths his sword and leaves the building, going off for a walk by himself. Jazzir sees him leave, but doesn't stop him from going. Seamus and Vilgrim remain standing over the body. Brande looks pretty horrified.
Jazzir returns, and says he will repay us in any way he can. The mages will retain the body. He then adds that we have much to discuss, and that he has contacted an ally. He starts to try and comfort us, but then sees we're really not in the mood for it, so he then tells us to meet him at the king's gate tomorrow. In the meantime, he's set us up in The Gilded Raven, the finest establishment in town, and everything is paid for. We're to tell the owner, Andraki Lenn, that Jazzir sent them, and everything will be sorted.
He asks before we leave if he can study Aleya's sword, in light of what we just fought. He promises to give it back tomorrow when we meet up. Angelo's pissed about it but can't think of a good reason to say no. The others all agree.
The rest of the party still in the building leave to go to the Raven, but Angelo asks Jazzir if he can access the library, because wizards have books. He gets pointed towards a few tomes. 18 investigation check. His focus is resurrection, and he's basically rage reading. It tends to vary depending on what religion you're talking about. Revivify, Silver Flame and dragonmarked house Golander(?). Doluhhr. The true soul slowly fades, and then it becomes hazy. Some suggest the soul is gone, leaving nothing but a faint echo. The Silver Flame suggest the soul merges with the Silver Flame. The Sovereign Host believe the soul exists on a plane that is not accessible until you have faded from Doluhhr. Higher levels of resurrection have been talked about, stories have been told about it. It does have limits on timing. Jazzir does comment that what he has done will extend the soul by ten days. The Silver Flame do have divine casters, but don't typically like resurrection, because it's seen as taking a soul from the Silver Flame, the truest calling for hero. The last bit of info he manages to get is that warforged, as per the "are they alive" debate, are shown to have souls and are therefore seen as living entities, but their souls do not seem to go to Doluhhr. Angelo rolls a 20 on his perception check, and sees Jazzir pick up one tome that was bound. It is titled, The Plane of Madness and the Entities That Dwell There. He had to literally unchain it to take it up to his study.
[It's about midnight now] He's been there for about 2 hours. He only takes one break to write briefly in his diary. Angelo takes a point of exhaustion, and finally gives up to go and sleep.
Meanwhile, the others enter The Raven. The doors open up to a grand entryway. Down the stairs sweeps a finely dressed half-elven gentleman, with blonde hair. [It's Angelo's cousin, damn] He introduces himself as Andraki Lenn. Vilgrim, Brande and Seamus introduce themselves as part of Jazzir's saviours. He then calls for "Sie" to help him. A human woman, wearing a nice dress, with long blonde hair. She's wearing a necklace that appears to have a shard of crystal attached. She gestures for the three of them to chill in a booth.
Vilgrim goes up to the bar, and asks for something strong. Andraki is happy to help, going off on a mad one about all the alcohol he can serve. Siennis telepathically tells Andraki to chill, and he pours Vilgrim a drink. Then he assesses our group, and pours Vilgrim a bit more.
Seamus is knackered and emotionally spent, so he goes up to the room key.
Vilgrim stays in the booth, listening in on some conversations, but he doesn't listen to much.
Ganraz sits by the river for a bit, and then goes to The Golden Dragon instead, which is notably more rowdy than The Raven.
Vilgrim is still up and receives a message. 'You are to meet with the Cannith agent. Listen to what he has to say, and report back.' It's a different voice to the one he's encountered before. He doesn't answer, he just spits. Andraki doesn't notice, but Siennis does. She doesn't act on it.
Seamus gets to his room, and gets ready for bed as much as possible. He pulls a pendant out of his pocket, and sends a message to his daughter. "Hello. I know I haven't spoken to you in a long time now, and you haven't spoken to me either. Today I lost a friend, and it made me think of you, and how I lost you too. I hope I hear back from you." There's a long pause [literally the discord is so quiet, fuck, the tension] "Father, it has been a while. I'm sorry to hear of your loss. There are so many losses lately. It is good to hear from you. Pascal and I are safe. I hope you are too."
Angelo does eventually come in, very late, and goes straight to the bar. "I want something strong enough that I can forget my own name." He downs it and goes up to bed.
Siennis doesn't live at the Raven, so she's leaving. As she does, she telepathically asks Andraki if he's going to stay up. They have a cute telepathic flirting moment, but it looks like nothing to anyone else, obviously.

{[h]Waking up in the morning}
Most of the party wake up in The Raven. Each room has its own ensuite, with self-heating baths, magic hair dryers, full length mirrors, etc. Seamus recognises all of this as pretty new, Cyran tech. The furnishings are even nicer/more modern that what Angelo had in Cyre.
The DM asks Brande to roll a percentile dice.
The whole party: Oh no.
Brande's sleep is restless. He has visions of Aleya's death over and over, and feels this surging rage. It feels… good, to channel this grief into the people who deserve it. He feels that it's their fault, the dragon's fault. He's drawn through a cloud of rage and grief, and the red smoke solidifies into a single point, which begins to grow, until it's a single red shard. It's ruby red, and appears to drift towards him. It seems to be no bigger than 5 or 6 inches. The hate begins to fade as the hate and the emotion begins to drift away, and he wants this thing. He wants the calm it gives him. And then he wakes up.
Ganraz, meanwhile, asks for directions to the Raven. Luckily, we sort of stand out, so he asks if the nearest person has seen "the red guy". They know him as The Nomad, so they know our Breaker names, sweet. He joins us for breakfast.
Andraki is doing his best to look after the party, offering tea and food. Brande asks if he has more meat. The DM has a menu somewhere. Siennis is not here yet. Andraki tells us that he's Draki to friends, but Ganraz insists on referring to him only as Andraki. He asks about the airship, and the dignitaries aboard it. Captain Eirros d'Lyrander, and it seems to be a joined endeavour with House Cannith. He admits that's basically all of his knowledge, and asks how he should address Ganraz and Seamus, as they're dragonmarked bois so he doesn't know if he should call them "my lords". They insist on only using their names, which he's fine with. Andraki asks if he should address them as d'Tharask and d'Cannith or not, and Ganraz immediately says no, his house doesn't use that, he's d'Barra. Andraki is incredibly embarrassed and flustered by the mistake, and hurries off.
Siennis is wearing a red dress this time, and notices us sitting for breakfast, and looks away to walk past. The dress shows a bit more of her back this time. Seamus and Ganraz roll perception, and get 17 and 23 respectively. Seamus doesn't notice anything other than her entrance. Ganraz does notice something off, as his gaze is sort of drawn away from her, and he's not sure if he imagined it, but there's a blurring effect near her back. He does a double take, looking back at it, but then her back looks normal. She goes to the bar, talking to Andraki who's hurriedly cleaning things. She tells him (out loud) that she'll need to leave earlier today, because she needs to go and speak to Jazzir. Hopefully she'll be here to help him pack when the city is evacuated. Andraki is still flustered, and notices that she's not fully enthusiastic about it. He then goes off on a tirade about not being briefed on the proper decorum when addressing dragonmarked heirs.
Brande goes over to Angelo's corner, and sits next to him. He asks if Angelo has ever seen a red crystal shape that might be magical. Angelo looks at him for a second, just absorbing the vagueness of that question, and then gets out his Black Book to have a look. He rolls a 15 on his history check, and he's heard of rubies etc for spell components, but he doesn't have much more info than that. Brande uses Minor Illusion to show him what the crystal looked like. Angelo asked if he saw that in Jazzir's room, because he didn't notice it. Brande says he thinks it will help. Angelo narrows his eyes, remarking that it didn't answer his question. Brande thinks that it will help stop what's happening to Aleya, and stop "what's happening".
Vilgrim asks if we can all follow him, and Andraki gives us a side room with curtains. Vilgrim begins, "As an old friend once told me…… The span of someone's life makes up only the core of their existence. No one is finally dead, until the ripples they cause in the world die away. On the grand scale of things, I knew Aleya for but a fleeting moment. Despite that, the mark she left behind will doubtless remain upon all of the lives of those who gather here today."
Angelo is literally about to walk out of this room.
Then Vilgrim continues, "With this thought, I must confess something to you all now. Before Aleya made her final journey, I made a promise to her, and despite her indifference to me keeping it at the time, I intend to follow through on it.
In normal circumstances I would never tell a soul what I'm about to tell you. But, in times like these…. and seeing as I've grown to trust you lot with my life over these past short days…. well… let's just say that I haven't been entirely straight up with you all, nevertheless, I'd like you all to at least hear me out.
For many years now I have worked to gather and exchange all manners of information at the behest of my government. In fact, that's how I ended up in this situation in the first place. A simple reconnaissance mission on the character of a caravan of refugees…
Well, with the… gravity.. of the situation that we find ourselves placed in continuing to grow and grow in magnitude, seemingly without end, its more than time now for me to do what I can."
Angelo's about to walk out, until Vilgrim says he's got something to confess. Vilgrim admits that he's been gathering intel for his government, and that's how he got to join the caravan anyway. Now that shit got real, he wants to do what he can to help our party, so that nothing happens again like what happened to Aleya. He plans to travel back to his homeland, which he hopes will allow him to bring aid. He doesn't know if he can do it, but the attempt is worthwhile. He then goes on to say that even though he knows that the relationships with some of the party members hasn't been exactly positive (Angelo snorts), he hopes the party can forgive him for being deceitful. Brande says Vilgrim is brave for confessing, and Ganraz says that Vilgrim has fought with us, so he's welcome to return and have a drink with Ganraz.
Andraki pops his head back in, and asks if we're available to talk to two people who have come with a message for Vilgrim and Seamus. Alpha barges past him [which is fucking rude, we should kill Alpha, Andraki is a GOOD BOI]. They hold up an orb they are carrying, and we hear Dolaan's voice come through, telling us he wants to meet with Seamus and Vilgrim at the earliest convenience.

{[h]Meeting with Jazzir}
Siennis has left a while ago.
It is rammed, there are guards calling to people, and there's a lot of people rushing towards the riverfront, where the King's Gate is. There's seems to be some commotion down by the river. As we approach, people sort of notice us and move out of the way. There used to be a wall here, and buildings have been built into the remains.
At regular intervals, we can see various Brindol Academy mages, with Jazzir in purple in the centre of the bridge. Everything goes silent as Jazzir finishes his incantation and raises his hands. The water level along the river pulls back and draws upwards. There's a 30ft high wall of water being maintained in the air, and the other members of the academy step forwards to help move this huge wall. They pull it back towards the King's Gate, until it becomes level with the bank, and begins flowing over the buildings. Jazzir steps back with the wall, until he finally reaches the King's Gate, and then drops one hand. As one, he and all the students push. It turns into a deep wall of ice.
There must be thousands of people, all watching, and as it freezes there's this loud intake of breath, and then everyone starts cheering.
Jazzir turns and addresses the crowd. His voice seems to be amplified. "By the will of the Academy, Brindol will not fall." There's a massive cheer, and the 50 students bow with him. As there's clamour all around us, Jazzir spots us. He apologises for the theatrics, and we join him on his journey back to the academy, to return to his study.
Naturally, this place immediately brings back terrible memories. Everything has been rearranged though, and Aleya has been moved to the Cathedral of the Sovereigns. As we enter, we see Siennis, who is wearing very practical but basically new leather armour, which is a mix of greens and greys. She seems to be prepared for more intensive activity.
Jazzir gestures for us all to sit, and Siennis goes over to him. She places a hand on his shoulder, and casts Lesser Restoration on his to remove fatigue, because he's obviously exhausted. He sits up a little straighter, and thanks her. He also thanks us again for his life. Now that he's had time to study the entity that attacked, he realises the true level of threat that we're dealing with. He first introduces Siennis properly, as Siennis Theil. We all hear her voice in our heads, telling us that it's nice to meet us. Ganraz and Angelo disliked that. Brande finds it weirdly familiar, which piques Siennis' curiosity, because why Brande. Jazzir goes on to tell Siennis to maybe not do that until we're used to her. He adds that he cannot leave Brindol, but Siennis can act in his stead. He then says he will leave us to discuss with Siennis.
Angelo and Seamus recognise her speech as one of who's from a noble household. She stumbles a little over the words, as if she's not used to speaking out loud. She apologises for startling us, and also for our loss. She knows she cannot replace "The Lioness", but she wants to help us with whatever we plan to do. Except for Seamus, none of us have heard of Aleya referred to as The Lioness.
Jazzir says he has researched the Ghostlord, Mr Flay, and also the sword of Usak Vaal. He asks which we'd prefer to hear about first. We pick Mr Flay, obviously. He explains that Mr Flay and Mr Gristle are entities of the Plane of Madness. He tried to fight them off using his – he says this in all of our heads – innate abilities. Everyone disliked that. He then asks if we'd heard of the Daelkyr, which is related to the mural we found way back in the prologue, in the tomb of Usak Vaal. The aberrations came through from the Plane of Madness, and were fought off by the Dekani(?) Empire. The Empire fell, even though they did manage to beat back the aberrations. Mr Flay and Mr Gristle were originally known at the Grimmkin, and they are two of three. They are the creation of a powerful being known as the Stained One. Trying to interact with such beings telepathically brings great pain, which is why Brande took damage when he tried to inflict psychic damage.
Siennis asks Jazzir telepathically if it's possible that the third one [the bone boi] is being used to control Mr Flay and Mr Gristle somehow. He says it's possible, and she relays this to the rest of the group. [So we're fighting Mr Flay, Mr Gristle, and Mr Calcium/Skeletor]
Jazzir also explains that the sword is good to use to destroy the Grimmkin for good. It will be our greatest weapon against the aberrations, and should be wielded by a champion. That's probably why the Red Hand wanted it; if Azarr Kul had it, he could sway more to his side.
He moves on to the Ghostlord, and knows the Stone Lion in the Field of Wounds, which is a tangle of sentient thorns. Jazzir's contacts who have investigated this area before have seen spectral lions. If the Red Hand are to use the Ghostlord's forces against the Vale, Brindol will probably fall. He also isn't sure about how our plan to convince the Ghostlord not to fight will go down, as he was a twisted, evil man. Dragons are bad, but he puts the Ghostlord high on the threat list.
Jazzir also tells us that one of the prominent guard captains in Denevar was attacked, but he's still alive. There was also an attack on the Hammerfist Holds, in which a couple of the leaders were killed. They all discuss different figures taking part in the attacks, but given the creature's abilities, it's probably Mr Flay and Mr Gristle masquerading as various entities.
The Grimmkin can't be truly destroyed unless all three are dead at the same time. We don't need to kill them simultaneously, but they all need to be dead at the same time.

{[h]We let Jazzir rest and shift to Vilgrim and Seamus' meeting}
The two of them head to the keep, seeing the Lyrander airship still tethered. They are met by Alpha, who leads them to the chambers of Dolaan. There's a desk which Dolaan is sitting at, and he's got a swivel chair that he seems to have brought himself.
He scooches over to where Vilgrim and Seamus are sitting, and says he has something to show them. He reveals a lifesize mechanical hummingbird, which flits around his head. Dolaan proves that he's Vilgrim's biggest fanboy, as he made a bird just for him because he knew Vilgrim likes birds. Seamus doesn't see the practical application, but ok fam, my friend died last night.
Dolaan gets back to business, and says that the Cannith agents will be reinforcing the wards set up by the Brindol Academy, and shoring up walls elsewhere. He fears that this city needs more aid that what limited augmentation he can provide. He then explains that he was here on a diplomatic mission, as House Cannith is currently in political turmoil. Many ambitious minds wish to lay claim to the house, and many of the traditional heirs were killed in The Mourning. There are three candidates. One is Zorlan(?) d'Cannith, who Seamus has heard of. His dragonmark appeared on his head, so he shaved his head. Dolaan says he wouldn't chuck in with him. There's Jorlana(?) in the west, and thinks her political past is sketchy at best, and would make a mockery of the House. Merricks is the best option, and he's based in Sharn. Even though he doesn't want to lead, he's the most suitable, and has Dolaan's loyalty. So, he gets to the point. He's well aware of Vilgrim's connections, and has been in contact with his masters. He believes they can work together, as House Cannith and Zilargo have worked together in the past. He is also aware of why Seamus disavowed the house, and notes that what Seamus and his brother did was outstanding. Dolaan also finds some of what House Cannith did during the war was distasteful. Jorlana holds the most favour at the moment, but thinks that with Merricks being bolstered he can lead. At the moment, they will be helping the Vale. Vilgrim will travel with Dolaan to Zilargo to discuss the arrangement with them. He hopes this will be the start of a profitable way forwards for both Zilargo and House Cannith. They don't need to decide anything now, but that's his full offer.
Seamus says that it's a very well thought out offer that he's made. He asks what the House can bring to the Vale if he accepts the offer. Dolaan says he's done work on the gates, and can leave a contingent of capable artificers if needed to maintain the wards. He doesn't have the assets he wished to bear, as he came here for diplomacy, not war. Seamus admits that his support would encourage him to take up Dolaan's offer.
Dolaan openly admits to not being the greatest fighter.

{[h]Another brief timeskip}
There's the sound of horns and bells ringing from Brindol keep. There's initial panic, and then we hear the call go out, "Ulverth returns! Gryphon riders on the horizon!"
There's a refugee caravan coming up the road, escorted by 5 gryphon riders above, and 5 gryphons fly ahead with the cavalry. Angelo recognises the colours of House Cristole at the head of the convoy.

We end the session here
