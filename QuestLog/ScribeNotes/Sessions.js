`{[h]The new campaign begins}
Aww yeah, it's monologue time.
Cyre was a nation of beauty. No longer.
[Five seconds in and I can't spell any of these goddamn names.]
The Last War ravaged Khorvaire for 102 years and was seemingly endless. But end it did. Some say it started in Metrol. But there are no true answers. No-one knows the origins of the mists either, but they covered the whole of Cyre, killing everything within, and stopped at the exact border.
The precious few who escaped were taken in by the kingdom of Breland. It is said that a new home is being built for refugees in the Elsir Vale.
This is where our story begins.
A lone cart at the back of the convoy, is surrounded by four figures. Two children, a boy of 6 (Merahl?) and a girl of 9 (Treza? Tressa?), are harassing a gruff, older gentleman. They call him Mr Seamus. What at first appears to be a tattoo on his arm is in fact metal bands welded into his skin. In the back of the cart is a heavily pregnant half-elven lady (Elaine?)
The children ask "Mr Red Skin" if he wants to join in. This is Brande of Kenna, a genasi. His long orange hair flits back and forth as the wind blows around. They are interrupted by a whistle.
Further up the caravan is a gnomish man, fairly unassuming. If he were human, you would assume he's in his mid-forties. Looks fairly friendly. This is Vilgrim. He whistles, and a magpie lands on his arm. The bird has found a coin. A red-haired human hops down from a cart near him, wearing a short bow. She's interested in how the gnomish man trained his magpie, called Jastiz. She's nicknamed Robin. She asks the half-elven man next to Vilgrim what he thinks of the bird. He's dressed in traveller's clothes, but looking closely reveals they are slightly finer cut than normal. He also has a side cape and a sword. Angelo the bard replies politely, "It's lovely, but it would be better if it wasn't attached to my keeper." Vilgrim grins at that.
Gareth, a dwarven man, is also with them, looking a bit dishevelled. Probably needs a wash. "Do you live in a forest?" Robin asks. Gareth confirms, as he's a druid, and Robin asks which one. Oops, we don't know yet. Gonna have to scroll along the map for a bit.
They are interrupted by the same whistle, and Robin says we should go and investigate. The four of us follow. We find an armoured human woman, with her dark hair tied up to keep it out of her face. Along the left side of her face is a large scar and burn marks. This is Aleya. Beside her is a half orc with a grey-blue skin tone. Few inches over 6 foot tall. He's broad and muscular. The grey skin poking out of the edge of his sleeve clearly shows what pretty much all of us recognise as a dragonmark. This is Ganraz.
Ganraz and Aleya can see a heavyset man with a clockwork hand and a metal plate welded to his forehead. Despite them interrupting him, he doesn't notice them, continuing to tell yet another war story which he'd been telling for the past 9 days. Marcos ___. He's in charge of the guard detail.
The whistle sounds again, and Marcos calls the caravan to a stop. It's his scout signalling him.
Sitting in the front stagecoach is a wizened old man. It's the stagehouse of House Crystol? He asks if there's a reason why we've stopped. Marcos tells him the scout has noticed something around the bend up ahead. He tells Ganraz to grab some willing individuals and go check what's blocking the road.
Whilst we wait for Seamus to regain consciousness due to his temporarily absent player, Brande climbs a slope to try and get a good viewpoint. Because he rolled a 1 +3, he hasn't gotten to a very good vantage point. He can't really see anything.
Brande, yelling down to the group: THERE'S NOTHING UP HERE, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'VE STOPPED
Aleya: Why the fuck is he yelling
Seamus comes to join us, and asks what he missed. Angelo lets him know that the genasi of the group can't climb.
We follow Ganraz and Aleya to investigate, and see something like a giant bird in the middle of the road. After an investigation check, the druid concludes that he has never seen a bird in his life. Ganraz does a little bit better, noticing red on the feathers. It's either injured or dead. When they approach, they see it's a fallen gryphon.
Aleya says we should leave because it's most definitely a trap. Ganraz agrees, but also points out they need to move the bird at some point because it's blocking the road. The scout, Jen, doesn't seem to be alarmed, but he is looking around.
The scribe thinks they bought a bag of yellow skittles by mistake, because god damn. Seven yellow, two orange, in one handful. WTF is happening.
Aleya and Ganraz advance, but give the fallen gryphon plenty of space. Gareth and Vilgrim approach because they're good with animals. Brande is sort of approaching too but I've lost the geography of exactly where he is now. He's approaching though.
Vilgrim determines that the creature in the middle of the road is not a bird. He knows birds, and this ain't it.
Being closer now, Aleya recognises it a little. She's seen pictures of creatures like this before being used as flying cavalry. So she knows that this is very dangerous.
Vilgrim continues to approach and can see several serious wounds on it. It is most definitely dead.
Aleya investigates. It looks like the gryphon dropped from the sky and skidded a little. It wasn't placed here by anyone. Jen rejoins them, easily bounding over the rocks. He has lupine features (he's a worgen) and sniffs the gryphon. It's about 2 days old. Jhen asks Gareth if he knows anything. Gareth rolls a 3 so he just knows it's a big fuck off dog and it's dead.
As Seamus and Angelo wait near the front of the caravan. They can easily see that the group ahead are not dead yet. The wizened old man pops his head out of the caravan, and tells them that they really must be getting on now. Angelo and Seamus agree. Seamus tells him that he's welcome to go and help if he likes. Angelo lets him know that they aren't dead so it's probably safe. The old man says that his adventuring days are over.
Aleya begins heading back. Gareth and Ganraz scout ahead. They spot a flock of crows, and one big vulture. Vilgrim investigates the body of the gryphon, getting out his notebook.
Ganraz questions the fact that carrion weren't on the body before we got there. Gareth confirms it's suspicious. They wonder if this adds to Aleya's suspicion of it being a trap.
Marcos joins Angelo and Seamus, and says it's a blockage. Gets a guy called Jast to convince Angelo and Seamus. Seamus says he wants to stay back, but Marcos says he'll give him a slap if he doesn't obey his orders.
Jast, Angelo and Seamus are impressed by the beastie's size. Angelo notices that Vilgrim's got his book out, warns the others that they'll be here all day. They all roll strength checks, but somehow the bard, the 72 year old artificer and Jast are the only ones who succeed. So they're the ones doing most of the work. Gareth had hold of the tail, and as he pulled the structural damage tears the gryphon apart. The acrid smell makes some of the group retch. Disgusting.
We return to the caravan. We're all a bit suspicious of that gryphon, especially as if it's a big beast that killed it, we could be in trouble later. Ganraz goes to the back of the caravan to check on Elaine and the children. The kids are asleep, but Elaine talks to him briefly about the gryphon. Seamus returns to them, and shares some stories with Ganraz.
Aleya seeks out Vilgrim, asking about the notes he was taking. She asks about how much he knows about gryphons, and what might have killed it. Vilgrim says that he really doesn't know what might have killed it. She wants to know if there were any man-made wounds on it. Vilgrim says that there were pierce marks on it, and maybe some tears on it. It didn't look like there'd been too much damage on it from feeding etc. Aleya notices Jastiz, asks about him.
Vilgrim can talk to animals, so he can hear Jastiz call all of us strange. Aleya gets the impression that the bird is looking at her funny.
Brande rolled two horrible perception checks, so all he can think about is how bad the gryphon smelled and how his feet are hurting.
Angelo does a bit better, and hears a message in his head, telling him to go up to the front of the carriage. He can reply to this message. He goes up to the front, and the elderly man from before introduces himself as Itaan Netanis? House Crystol? He serves Lady Elise who is with him. Family famous for making illusionary dyes. She's 14, dressed in the blue and gold of her house. Wrapped in a shawl, which is covered in what looks like emeralds, but they blink like stars.
He has heard that Angelo is quite eloquent and asks for his assistance in potential negotiations. Despite his player not feeling up to it, as they aren't very eloquent, Angelo would be pleased to be of help.
We set up camp for the night, and figure out who's going to take what watch.

{[h]In camp}
Seamus and Brande are in the first watch. Brande is staring into the fire, despite supposed to be on lookout. Seamus, however, is keeping an eye on the forest, and sees various trees, rocks, and he hears the occasional animal noise. About an hour in, he's making slight adjustments to his arm, and he notices a shape in the distance. He hears a strange noise, and what looks like maybe a large bird lands in the trees. It seems to be flying from tree to tree. It's not coming towards them, it's just moving around. It sits there for a bit, and he's not sure if it's watching him, but then it flies away.
Seamus warns Angelo and Aleya on the next watch. He saw a big bird, so they should keep an eye out for that.
Aleya: You saw a bird. In a tree.
She seems unimpressed.
Angelo and Aleya's watch is mostly uneventful, until Aleya decides to investigate the forest a bit more. She sees a vulture hanging out, and shoots a ray of frost at it. Angelo jumps up, surprised, and asks what the hell she's shooting at. She tells him it's for caution. They bicker for a bit about the necessity of shooting magic into the woods in the middle of the night, and then they see a large silhouette in the trees.
Angelo: Aleya dear, did you see that as well?
Aleya: Yes. Get Ganraz. Now.
Angelo wakes Ganraz, they both fill him in. Ganraz bellows and wakes the whole camp. As he does so, they hear something crashing through the forest towards them.
Angelo: Well that's a big bloody bird.
A huge hulking green creature charges into the clearing, accompanied by five wolves with goblin riders, one dismounted goblin, and the vulture transforms into a strange hooded figure. Uh oh.

{[h]First combat of the campaign}
Seamus is up first, and he's woken up to utter chaos. He looks around for Elaine, Tresa and Myrel, and then burns a spell slot to charge his arm. He charges forwards, making sure his group are safe.
The goblins go next. Goblin A shoots at Seamus, but misses.
Goblin B charges at one of the human guards, slicing at him as he rides past.
Goblin C shoots at Angelo, but misses.
Goblin D charges at Aleya, dealing 8 points of damage.
Goblin E shoots at Ganraz but misses.
Dismounted/armoured Goblin dashes at Angelo, his warg comes with him.
The hooded figure slinks towards Seamus. He casts some spooky spell and deals psychic damage to Seamus, making him run away.
The giant green figure is actually a troll, and it stomps forwards. It swipes the injured human guard, yeeting him backwards into the campfire.
Vilgrim sneaks forwards, hiding behind a tent and shooting at the goblin about to attack Aleya. He deals 14 damage and kills it instantly.
Angelo is engaged by three things, including a hulking troll that just bit him. He disengages, gasping "It fucking bit me" in utter disbelief. As he turns, the troll swats at him, tearing part of his side cape, which is annoying. He then gives bardic inspiration to Aleya. "Aleya, darling, kill that thing for me, this was expensive."
Brandu darts forwards, casting Burning Hands on the troll. He deals 6 damage.
Ganraz uses Commander's Strike.
Aleya slashes with her sword, dealing 15 damage to the warg in front of her. There's a sizzle of blood as its head falls from its body. Definitely dead.
Seamus returns, casting firebolt at Goblin B, but it narrowly misses.
Another goblin attacks Aleya, but she manages to deflect it with her shield.
Another attacks Ganraz, dealing 10 damage.
The troll attack Ganraz but misses with both attacks. Frustrated, it backhands the guard next to Dio Brando.
Vilgrim shoots at another goblin rider, picking it off of the warg easily and killing it instantly with 14 damage. That sneak attack is crazy. He also shoots at the troll, dealing 8 points.
Elaine, who is heavily pregnant, charges into camp to get the children. She's a bloody hero.
Angelo, seeing Ganraz taking damage and knowing that if he dies, Angelo will probably die next, he casts Healing Word on the half orc and gives him 7hp back.
Brandu-chan is next, dealing 7(?) slashing damage.
Ganraz uses Manoeuvring Strike. He deals 13 damage. He then shouts to Aleya to go after the armoured goblin. She muscles her way past the troll, charging towards the armoured goblin behind it. Ganraz then deals 11 damage to the troll, and now it looks quite hurt. He then uses Manoeuvring Strike on Bran too and he manages to dart around the warg rider nearby.
Aleya deals 12 damage to the armoured goblin, using Booming Blade. She then casts Thunderwave on the area, and the goblin and the warg are killed immediately.
Seamus uses firebolt again, dealing 12 points of fire damage. It's blown off of the warg's back.
The hooded figure turns back into its vulture form and books it.
Riderless wargs start running when the realise they're losing this fight.
The troll launches another assault on Ganraz, but he's a strong boi and is holding back each blow with his shield.
Vilgrim shoots at the troll whilst it's distracted by Ganraz. The arrow lodges beneath its collarbone, dealing 15 damage.
Angelo casts Healing Word on himself, giving himself 4hp back, and then runs and slides into cover behind where Vilgrim is. Vilgrim is trying to be the night, so he's not pleased that the bard is seeking refuge in his blind spot.
Brans takes 7 and then 6 damage from the goblin and the warg near him. He then deals 12 points of piercing damage to the vulture as it flees, but although it's wounded it's not going down. He hurries to the treeline, trying to keep it within sight.
Ganraz manoeuvres around the troll and takes a swing at the troll. His blade scrapes the side without damaging it.
Aleya charges after the armoured goblin and his warg and uses Booming Blade on the warg. She deals 10 damage, obliterating the warg. The rider is prone. She lowers her sword, pointing the tip at the goblin's neck, and tells him "Stay the fuck down." Damn Aleya, you scary.
Seamus moves towards the goblin closest to him, dealing 16 damage with his flaming axe. The goblin is thrown well off of his warg, spiralling through the air in a very dead mess.
The goblin close to Ganraz, as does his warg, but both miss.
The warg by Seamus tried to run, so Seamus got an attack of opportunity, dealing 13 damage and killing it.
The armoured goblin, despite Aleya's strict instructions, manages to get up, disengage, and run off into the forest.
The troll claws at Ganraz, dealing 12 damage, and though the second misses, he takes 12 damage from the third attack.
Vilgrim remembers he's a smol boi, and realises he can't just walk over there. However, he can dash, so he sprints over to where the troll is. He draws his rapier, slashing at it and dealing 17 damage. His blade goes through its thigh and pulls back. Green blood spills everywhere. It looks pretty bad.
Angelo is really tired of this shit now, and casts Vicious Mockery on the troll mostly by accident. Sort of like a reflex. (DM kindly reminded the player that they could cast it, and their response was "I don't know how to use it and I'm too tired to care now". The party decided this counted) He deals 4 psychic damage to the troll. He then, grumbling all the time, casts Healing Word on Ganraz again, unable to believe that he's having to use his magic. Ganraz regains 8 hp.
Brande fires an arrow at the goblin, but it misses. He moves away to a safe distance.
Ganraz is looking pretty rough.
Vilgrim lashes out with his rapier, slashing a V into its chest, before stabbing it upwards through the head and sending it crashing to the ground. First boss kill of the campaign, ya boi Vilgrim's got this.
Aleya shoots a Ray of Frost at the fleeing goblin's legs. It deals 8 damage, and the goblin drops.

{[h]End of battle/session}
Seamus rushes to check on Elaine and the kids. Others go to help Aleya get the goblin she caught. Markos comes running in, and despite a slight cut on his forehead he looks fine. Jast also appears to be fine. He yells that Lady Elise has gone missing, taken by some of the raiding goblins.
And that's where we end the session.
We level up. No, for real. We're level 4 now.`

`{[h]At the camp}
We're only a day and a half away from the Elsyr Vale. After a raid by a party of goblins and a troll, we take a moment to reflect on how the battle went and the knowledge that Lady Elise is gone.
Markos asks Ganraz what the hell happened. Ganraz gives a quick recap of our situation, and Markos sends Jast and some men to scout the treeline. Aleya approaches, dragging the unconscious goblin behind her. She checks in on Ganraz, and Brande is also pretty beaten up. Seamus and Ganraz check in on Elaine and the kids. They're ok, just a bit shaken up.
Markos says we did better than they did; half of their guard got split up, many of them dead, and he and Jast had to fight their way out of a corner. He reckons we put up more of a fight than the goblins anticipated. Markos is also surprised that the goblins have raided a caravan as big as ours. Aleya says we'll learn more when our goblin guest wakes up. Markos tells us that he saw them targeting girls in particular, and Aleya finds it curious how specific their target it.
Vilgrim knows that a (now officially recognised) nation of goblins lead by a guy called Haruk (?) were hired as a fighting force for Cyre, and then claimed all of the land. Angelo rolled badly, so he accidentally doesn't know this. (An omen from the dice gods?)
Brande tries to kick the goblin awake. It's ineffective. Now that we can see him better, we can see he's wearing a helmet that obscures the face, and his armour is a patchwork of leather and dark green plate. He's got quite a large wound in his leg. Seamus goes for a medicine roll; it's a 5. Definitely an omen from the dice gods.
Aleya removes its helmet and buckler. There is a fairly large tattoo on his neck. Through her search, she discovers a direwolf fang on his belt, with something carved into it. He's got 5 gold pieces and 5 silver, most of them seeming half chewed. He also seems to have a feather pendant. She removes all of these, and gives the direwolf fang to Ganraz because she can't read goblin.
Ganraz can and translates it roughly to "alpha".
Jen and Robin enter. She looks a little less cheerful than she normally does, and hurries to where Jast is. Jen hurries over to Markos, and says he will try to check for traps etc. Jen then joins Jast and the others, as does Brande.
Ganraz grabs a tankard of water, pouring it over the goblin's face. He comes to. His right eye is ruined, but his left eye is pale and milky. He does appear to be looking at us though. Ganraz asks him to make this easy. The goblin says he would not prefer death, but he doubts that Ganraz can help. Ganraz gets a 19 on his intimidation roll. Apparently, the goblins were sent by The Outcast, named Kar'vun (apparently he's a hobgoblin). He points at his eye, and then the tattoo on his neck, and says that The Outcast did this to him. The plan was to take any one of the girls in our caravan who might be young or pure. "He seeks a great prize in the mountains." Ganraz then asks where Lady Elise has been taken. Goblin tells us it's maybe a half day's ride, past the soldier's leg, there is a tomb.
Angelo rolls high on an insight check, and notices that the goblin keeps touching his tattoo, almost like a tick. He makes a note of this in his little black book. For now he remains quiet and unnoticed.
The goblin tells Ganraz that he was against Kar'vun, and so The Outcast killed him. Ganraz asks what that means, but then switches back to common to tell us what happened. The goblin then tells us that the mark is his link to The Outcast. Ganraz then says that we can no longer speak in front of him.
The goblin sits up and says he will help us. He then draws us a map in the dirt. It leads to Tulin's Seat, which is a name Aleya and Angelo recognise. Before he can tell us any more, his hand snaps away from his neck, and his eye flashes purple. Aleya draws her sword, suspicious. The goblin's eye then turns back again, and he starts to say 'Hel—' before she cuts his head off.
Aleya and Markos make a plan; the caravan should hurry to the next stop, whilst we go after Lady Elise.
The rest of the caravan is packing up getting ready to move. Vilgrim manages to get away from the group, and sends a message. Sneaky boi.
Angelo rolls a history check, and knows that Tulin's Seat is a local name for that particular peak. He remembers something about it being named after a dwarf. The other place that the scribe can't spell, he has no idea about.
Jen asks if we need his services, but as Vilgrim, Ganraz and Angelo have drawn up the map, and Brande has a good track on the vulture.
Angelo finishes writing notes in his black book, and sees Vilgrim near to him. He snaps it shut, tucking it back into his tunic. Vilgrim squints at him.
Itaan, Elise's aide, is bandaged heavily. He's unconscious, and apparently fought hard to keep Elise safe. He'll probably be ok, Seamus saw to that.

{[h]Let's hunt some goblin}
Seamus remains behind to guard the children.
Brande and Ganraz are leading, as they're the best trackers. Following them is Gareth, and Angelo and Vilgrim make up the middle ranks, with Aleya bringing up the rear.
Brande and Ganraz both roll survival; Brande 11 and Ganraz 7. Ganraz is starting to get a bit confused due to his concussion, but Brande can see the tracks just fine. Brande and Gareth roll perception. They can tell that most of the animals have been scared off, seeming quiet because of the troll crashing through the tree.
Brande and Ganraz roll again, B 11 G 15. They get more of an idea that there are double the tracks coming in our direction than are going back. The raiding party clearly suffered many losses.
We reach a lake between two mountains. There's no trees anymore, it's just slopes and short grass, with lots of rock. Not much cover. We can see in the distance that there is a statue; it's the soldier that Ganraz told us about.
Brande asks if we're likely to encounter traps. Aleya confirms this.
Angelo asks Vilgrim where Jastiz is. He tells the half elf that he left his bird back with the caravan. "Well, there goes my idea." But Gareth cottons onto what Angelo was going to suggest, and turns into a rabbit to go and investigate ahead.
He can see there's a lot of rubble in front of the statue, and a large sword lies in it (made of the same stone). It's dressed in what looks like plate armour. He can't tell what creature it might be, he can only see legs. He can't read the plaque either, because it's in goblin.
Whilst we're waiting, Ganraz turns to Vilgrim and asks what he used to do. Vilgrim tells him that he used to travel the world and document the different species. He was also fought a bit during the war. He rolls an 18 on his deception, whilst Ganraz does not roll well. It makes sense that Vilgrim would be good at fighting, lots of people were caught up in the war.
Brande checks the area; there is a low mist, but judging from what he can tell, our enemies will have advantage if we approach, because we have no cover. The mist is starting to clear a bit because the morning is wearing on.
Aleya ritual casts Detect Magic. She can detect a faint sense of divination from Vilgrim, faint enchantment from Angelo, and faint abjuration from Brande.
Gareth returns, and tells us that there's nothing threatening to bunny rabbits over there. So it's probably safe.
We choose speed over stealth, breaking cover and making our way over to the statue. As we get as close as Gareth got, Ganraz can read the plaque. It's in very ancient goblin, "This land is his. This is his vigil." Gareth can tell that the statue is artfully done, but although it's similar to dwarvish style it wasn't made by his dwarf bois.
Aleya's Detect Magic can only detect very faint traces of abjuration, but her ritual spell is almost at its end. It's more like an aftertaste of magic.
We continue on after investigating the statue. Ganraz and Brande roll 16 and 15 on their survival checks respectively. They can follow the trails where some of the wargs and the goblin have passed over the stone. We all roll a perception check, and at least half of us roll pretty well. We've climbed up to where the waterfall is, and as we start to crest up a ridge, those of us who rolled high spot some loose rocks fall ahead of us. We're still climbing, and have to go up to where that scree slope is. There aren't any big rocks, just some small ones.
Nobody really fancies taking the scree slope of death, so we continue on the path.
Brande and Ganraz roll another survival, but they're starting to lose the tracks. It's a lot of loose rock, so there's not much to leave tracks on. The vague path we've been following ends, and we discover a scree slope which seems like a false peak.
Vilgrim, being the lightest, scrambles up the scree slope (but stealthily). He makes pretty decent progress, and through his scouting he has a pretty good idea of where to guide us to go. He decides to climb up to the ridge and guide them from there (but stealthily). When he reaches the top, he sees a lot of loose rubble and a small entrance in the rocks. It looks like a lot of rock has been shifted from within and moved out to the sides of it. There is the remains of a fire that looks like it's recently been put out.
As he's climbing down to guide us up, he slips a little bit. Thinking quickly, he casts minor illusion to disguise the sound of falling rock with birds. It's pretty convincing.
The rest of the party join him. Pretty much everyone rolls well, except for Ganraz who gets a 1. His heavy armour clinks against the rocks, and we all wait with bated breath. Gareth rolls the highest perception, and can hear hushed whispers.
Brande reaches the top first, but despite getting a 16 on his stealth check, a volley of arrows comes sailing over the ridge.

{[h]Oh shit oh fuck}
Initiative order: Vilgrim, Gareth, Brande, Ganraz, Aleya, Angelo.
Vilgrim gets low, darting to his left and taking cover behind the ridge where the goblins are. He's a pretty stealthy boi. He's safe in cover. He prepares to scramble up.
Gareth moves to the right, taking cover behind a large rock, and casts Entangle on the three archer goblins at the top of the ridge. Two of them are restrained.
Brande charges forwards. He can see that they are armed with spears. He can't really tell if the vulture goblin has healed from last time. He then uses his Planar Warrior ability. Orange glow begins to spread from Brande's hand, and as he draws and notches an arrow, we hear a crackling sound. He marks the blue goblin, loosing this translucent, crackling arrow and dealing 14 force damage. Its chest just implodes, and he's launched backwards. He then backs up.
Five of the goblins move up to the edge, and hold their action. Two more archers appear at the top. They shoot at Ganraz, Gareth and Brande. Gareth is missed, but one arrow strikes Ganraz, dealing 7 piercing damage. Another arrow hits Brande, dealing 5 damage.
The vulture goblin steps forwards, raising his hands, and both Brande and Ganraz feel shadows beginning to clutch at their chests. They both manage to shrug off the Bane that he was trying to cast on them. Ganraz flexes and shrugs off the shadows, whilst a heat shimmer around Brande fends it off.
The wargs run and jump over the top of the goblins, trying to attack Ganraz and Brande. The warg attacking Brande misses, but the one attacking Ganraz deals 9 damage. It tries to wrestle him to the ground, but fails to do so because of Ganraz's impressive muscles.
Ganraz charges past the warg, rushing the goblins. Green and orange goblins try to hit Ganraz, because they readied their actions, but both miss.
Aleya sprints forwards, slashing at the orange goblin, and deals 15 damage. It crumbles to the ground, dead.
Angelo steps forwards, and sees the vulture goblin. He surmises that it's the biggest threat, considering the damage it can do, so he casts Vicious Mockery on it. "You, sir, are the reason mind flayers starve to death." It takes 4 psychic damage, and has disadvantage on its next roll. He then draws his rapier in preparation for what may come next.
From within the darkness stomps what appears to be an ogre. Shitu.
Vilgrim climbs up the ridge; none of the goblins have noticed him, so he shoots at the vulture goblin. He deals 20 damage, and then scrabbles back down the ridge to bonus action hide.
Gareth drops his entangle spell, turning his hands and willing a sphere of flame on the orange and green archers. It deals 11 points of damage to both of them, instantly incinerating them. He then bowls it to the right, the flames slamming into the purple archer and knocking it off the cliff with 8 points of damage. It's also very dead.
Brande casts Burning Hands in a cone of flame; the red goblin sees Brande in time and takes half damage, but green goblin takes 9 damage and dies a screaming death.
The ogre brings his weapon down onto Ganraz, but he dodges and it crashes into the stone next to him. The second attack rings against Ganraz's shield, but doesn't hit him.
The vulture boi runs for the entrance, and tries to cast Dissonant Whispers on Aleya, but she's not having any of that shit.
The red goblin tries to grapple Ganraz, but basically bounces off of him.
The purple and pink goblins try to attack Aleya.
The red and blue archers panic shoot at Gareth. One of them hits, and he loses concentration on his spell.
One of the wargs tries to attack Brande, whilst the other goes after Ganraz. The one attacking Brande misses, and the warg attacking Ganraz tries to maul him but once again bounces off him.
Ganraz commands Vilgrim to kill the vulture goblin. The gnome was waiting for the order; he darts forwards, dealing 12 damage. His arrow goes all the way through his back, and the hood tumbles, revealing a very ugly goblin. It's very dead. Ganraz's turn continues (wait there's more!), but his attack seems to slide off its armour. The warg at his back isn't helping matters.
Aleya uses her flame blade on the ogre, but it misses.
Angelo sees that red goblin has taken a lot of damage, so he casts Vicious Mockery on it. As it's watching its companions perish in fire, it spots a half elven man in the midst of the chaos. Angelo looks at him and says "I was expecting someone taller," dealing 4 psychic damage. It begin to cry blood and collapses, dead. The bard just killed someone. Holy shit. He then notices that Aleya has taken some damage too, so he casts Healing Word on her, giving her 7hp back.
Vilgrim tries to shoot at the ogre, but just misses. He takes a chance, bonus action hiding before anyone notices where the shot came from.
Gareth casts another flaming sphere, dropping it onto the ogre and the purple goblin. It kills the goblin instantly, dealing 7 damage, but the 7 damage didn't seem to phase the ogre; it's on fire, and doesn't currently seem bothered.
Brande shoots at the ogre, but it misses.
The pink goblin tries to attack Aleya, but misses.
The two archers try to shoot at Aleya and Angelo. They both hit, taking damage. Angelo could have burned a bardic inspiration, but he decided to save it and take it like a twink.
The warg wrestles Ganraz to the ground, dealing 6 damage.
The warg attacking Brande manages to deal 12 damage. Brande uses Hellish Rebuke, dealing 18 points of fire damage. The warg basically shrivels from the heat and dies.
The ogre moves to its left, dealing 12 points of damage to Ganraz, and then attacks Aleya twice. She manages to get her shield up, and deflects the damage. The ogre takes 7 damage at the end of his turn (courtesy of Gareth's flaming sphere.
Ganraz decides to not pull too much against the warg, trying to minimise damage, and orders Vilgrim to shoot at the warg. Vilgrim deals 15 damage, but it's still hanging in there.
Aleya slashes at an exposed bit of leg, dealing 10 damage. She action surges, attacking the warg. (She doesn't need to roll here because it's gonna be dead, so I'll say she gets another 10 for the purpose of counting up).
Angelo sees this horrifying display of mauling from the warg, and casts Healing Word on Ganraz, giving him 7hp back. He then tries to cast Vicious Mockery on the ogre, but is just so disgusted by the creature that he can't think of anything clever to say.
Vilgrim is tired of firing from the shadows, dealing 14 damage with his rapier. Its leg is now dragging, basically severed after being attacked by both Aleya and Vilgrim. The ogre uses its reaction to use Looming Presence, and Vilgrim is now frightened. He disengages, running back.
Gareth maintains his bowling ball of doom.
Brande moves past the frightened gnome and the ogre, taking a shot at the red archer on the ridge. He deals 11 force damage, shooting him straight in the head and snapping backwards. He's definitely dead.
The last blue archer rolls a morale check, and not surprisingly he runs the fuck away.
The ogre deals two attacks to Aleya and Ganraz. It gets a nat 20 on Aleya, and she is down. It takes damage from Gareth's fire bowling ball.
Ganraz steps to the side, putting himself between the ogre and Aleya, and swings at him. He deals 9 slashing damage.
Aleya's making death saving throws. That's an oof, yikes, Scoob.
Angelo sees this, and he rushes forwards. He grabs Aleya under the arms, dragging her backwards out of harm's way, and casts second level Healing Word on her. She regains 9hp, no longer in danger of dying, phew.
Vilgrim makes it back behind the rocks, taking a very shaky shot at the ogre. It misses due to his fear.
Brande slashes at the ogre, dealing 11 force damage. His scimitar is blazing with orange light.
The ogre slashes at Ganraz. Its first attack misses, but the second deals 12 damage.
Ganraz isn't gonna take any of that shit. He 11 damage. He casts his shield aside, leaping up and plunging his sword through the creature's chest. Its knee physically buckles because of the damage to the leg. Ganraz keeps forcing it down, and when he lets go, the creature is dead, stationary. Locked in this position by Ganraz's sword.
NOTE TO PLAYERS: Loot fucking everything.
We can now investigate the door, and Ganraz sees an ancient goblin plaque. It roughly translates as "This ground is his. Grovel to him." Usakvaal's Rest.`

`{[h]Post-battle recap}
Lady Elise has been taken by goblins. We hurried to follow. Got ambushed. Shit. We were doing ok until an undead ogre got into the mix, then we had some trouble. Aleya got injured, quite badly, but we did kill the ogre and the vulture goblin.

{[h]We all assess the damage}
Aleya is feeling like shit. Her ribs aren't broken, thanks to Angelo's magical healing, but she's in a lot of pain. She asks if we can stop for like 5, 10 minutes just to catch our breaths.
Gareth casts cure wounds on Aleya, giving her 15hp. He then casts Cure Wounds on Ganraz, giving him 8hp. He gives Ganraz another 10hp with a second cast. He then uses his last wildshape to transform into a wolf. He then pads off, making sure that we're not flanked by any wargs that might appear. Angelo casts Healing Word on himself, giving himself 8hp back.
Vilgrim investigates the vulture goblin. He gets an 18; the goblin has milky white eyes, and it smells of rot rather than the acrid smell from before. He feels warm, instead of cold like the alpha goblin. He's got a pendant, which appears to be a humanoid molar tied on a cord. He's also carrying 20 gold and 10 silver. He's also got various pouches of weird witchy shit, which Vilgrim doesn't have any idea about. On one of his fingers, he's wearing a brass ring, with red engravings on it that form a wave pattern. Vilgrim slips this into his pocket.
Brande and Angelo have a look at the ogre. We kick it over onto the floor; looking at the armour, it's clearly torn up, and it's too big for any of us to wear regardless. The blades are large, meat cleaver looking things, very rusty. Taking the helmet off, we can see there's a large tattoo on its neck. It's the exact same as the alpha goblin's. The ogre is cold to the touch.
Ganraz moves toward the entrance, looking for tracks etc. He can see that it goes about 15ft in, and just at the edge of his dark vision he can make out what looks like a large, cuboid raised section.
Aleya finishes ritual casting Detect Magic, and senses necromancy from the ogre, and restoration from the direction of the vulture goblin. She also gets a strong sense of abjuration from something behind the rocks around the entrance, as in there's a lot of it, probably in various places. She warns Ganraz, telling him that she can sense a magical presence, and although she can't tell whether it was designed to keep something out or in. She does know it's something protective in nature.
It's time to move in. Ganraz lays down the battle plan; stick together, don't fuck around, and if we find Elise, we should consider other options from just attacking. Aleya also suggests that Brande watch our backs, to make sure we don't get flanked.
Walking order: Ganraz, Aleya, Vilgrim, Angelo, Brande.
Brande, to Angelo: Don't worry, I'll keep you safe.
Angelo: I appreciate the sentiment, dear.

{[h]In the cave}
As Ganraz reaches the edge of the raised dais, torches light themselves. On the back wall, we see a mural depicting a battle. The battle seems to be centred around the lake, whilst hobgoblins hold the ridge against a many-eyed creature that seems to be from the depths of hell. Great.
One figure stands directly in front of the creature, wearing armour.
Angelo isn't comforted by the mural. Aleya's Detect Magic is still going.
[Scribe Note: Missed a big chunk of lore about the mural here, because I was grabbing my dinner. I'm a failure of a scribe]
Aleya tells us that this place we have found is very old. She asks if anyone knows about the hobgoblin empire or stories. Angelo remembers the story vaguely, but he doesn't have any more information beyond what everyone in the group already knows.
Ganraz checks the door that's slightly ajar, but he can't hear anything within. There is a slight breeze going past him, but that's all.
Aleya checks the other door, and finds it's unlocked. She asks which way they want to go. Ganraz suggests we take the smaller door first.
Vilgrim investigates the dais, and he can see that it's an altar of some sort. But then he rolled a 5 with his blighted dice, so he can basically just see what the rest of us can see. There's some urns, some cloth, but no blood, so that's nice.
We're trying the door on the left. Aleya tries to open it quietly, but it's very heavy and scrapes a little bit. The hinges aren't rusted though.
Aleya and Ganraz decide to advance. They draw their swords, checking out the corridor behind the door. The corridor doesn't look as polished and well-preserved as the previous area.
Whilst they're exploring, Brande checks the other door, but rolls a perception of 8. Soooo that could go either way, really.
Back with Ganraz, he's checking out the three doors he's just found. He finds a room with the ruined frames of what appeared to have once been beds.
[Scribe note: Not going to write all of the investigation here, because I'm eating dinner. If it's relevant to plot, I'll add it, but typing and eating is hard. Suffice to say, Ganraz and Aleya are investigating rooms and they're still alive.]
The Dream Team speculate about the purpose of this place; if it's a shrine of some sort, then it doesn't seem to have been used recently. They poke through various crates, but only one contains something of interest. Aleya finds a pouch that smells kind of powdery, like incense. She has some knowledge of components for spells, so she believes that this incense may have magical applications. She doesn't know what to do with it, but she decides to hang onto it.
Meanwhile, Angelo and Vilgrim are both snacking now, but Angelo has the time to appreciate the mural and the room as a whole, being one who likes art and stories and stuff. He can enjoy this place as a root of a story. Vilgrim is horrified by the pictures.
He takes a moment to look at the ring he's found. He can't tell any more than he already did, so he shows it to Angelo, asking what it might be. Angelo doesn't know, because he can't Detect Magic or anything, but he can see it's pretty. Vilgrim considers putting it on, and Angelo stops him, asking him where he got it from. Vilgrim admits he got it from the vulture goblin. Angelo thinks that that's a terrible idea. Brande overhears this, and agrees that items from a vulture goblin in league with a necromancer. They bicker a little over the risk-reward.
Ganraz's attempt to pick the lock on the door doesn't work, so he does the next best thing – He kicks the shit out of it. Aleya helps.
They discover a room with a nice, well-preserved desk. Ganraz assesses it to be a priest's quarters, maybe. Aleya agrees, and Ganraz searches the desk. The right-hand draw doesn't have anything special in it. In the next one, there's a false bottom to the draw. Inside is a piece of paper with legible markings. There's also a circular brass pendant, with six rubies in it. There's also a dark, leather bag.
As he retrieves these things, Ganraz looks to his right and sees a figure in faint, ethereal blue. It looks at him, tilts its head, and then fades backwards through the wall. Piss off, ghost.
It scares the shit out of Ganraz and Aleya, and their surprised yells draws the attention of Brande, Angelo and Vilgrim. Brande rushes to them, but Angelo and Vilgrim hang back, waiting to see whether people are dead or not.
Ganraz tells Brande there's ghosts, sounding a bit panicky, and Aleya tells him they've fought worse than ghosts before. It's a lie.
They discover that the piece of paper Ganraz found earlier is actually a thin piece of rock, and he translates it aloud to Aleya and Brande.
Angelo peeks around the corner, checking to see if everyone's still alive. Brande tells him there's ghosts. Angelo is not thrilled by the news. Ganraz relays the information on the tablet to the others, and Angelo recognises the word Ja'shaarat – it's the original name for the hobgoblin capital, got ruined, then became Sharn.
We all regroup in the chamber, and Vilgrim decides to at last put his ring on. We all think it's a terrible idea, but he's doing it. Nothing seems to happen, aside from a fluttering in his gut and the need to run, which only lasts a second. We're all suspicious nonetheless, and Ganraz warns Vilgrim that if that ring means he's going to get haunted by a hobgoblin ghost from now on, he won't be pleased.
Ganraz and Aleya haul the other door open, and we see a long corridor, stretching out to a staircase at the end. There's an eight foot statue in front of us. Ganraz looks around, and can see that there's been some dust disturbed. Angelo rolls a bit higher on his investigation, and notices that the floor is worn. Vilgrim suggests that it might be a place for praying.
Angelo slowly and awkwardly kneels before the statue, not sure how much he trusts this situation and a bit embarrassed in front of the others. Nothing seems to happen. Ganraz kneels next to him, putting some gems on the base of the statue. Still nothing.
Angelo, whispering: Ganraz, if a ghost pops out, there's no shame in running, is there?
Ganraz, also whispering: No, definitely not.
Angelo: Excellent, we're in this together.
Ganraz gets up, and tries walking down the corridor. His vision blurs for a moment, and the walls seem to shimmer, but nothing happens to him. Seeing this, Angelo also creeps past the first pillars, and nothing happens to him. They both reach the end of the corridor. Aleya follows, saluting the statue first, and nothing happens to her. Seeing their companions are all right, Vilgrim and Brande also kneel before the statue before following. Nothing happens to them either, although Brande sees demonic shapes with teeth somewhere behind him. So that's fun.
We all reach the stairs at the end of the corridor.

{[hi]We descend}
Walking order: Ganraz, Aleya, Angelo, Vilgrim, Brande
Ganraz creeps round the corner, and sees that it's going to open out into a chamber. He turns back to the party, and puts a finger to his lips. Ooooh, we stealthin' bois. Ganraz 16. Brande 22. Angelo 20. Vilgrim 27. Aleya 4.
Ganraz sneaks forwards because he's feeling stealthy today, and peers into the room. The room appears to be full of statues. There's no inscriptions of names, but they are impressive. Some bear swords, some have details like circlets etc, and all are lifesize. The room is cold.
Vilgrim takes a big ol sniff, and can't smell the same rot from before. The flame, despite what is normal for fire, doesn't seem to smell of anything either, no crackling wood or anything.
As they near the other door, Angelo hears voices whispering ahead of them. He hurries forwards and stops Ganraz from continuing, warning him of the voices. He then suggests that he could perhaps turn one of the party invisible, if we wanted to stealth ahead. The group agree it's a good idea, so Angelo sizes up Vilgrim, and then clicks his fingers. The gnome is now invisible.
Vilgrim sneaks ahead whilst the party waits behind. He finds another room with an even larger undead ogre in it. Behind him are two more figures, one in a cage and one standing beside a sarcophagus. Lady Elise is in the cage, apparently unconscious. The other figure is scribbling on the ground, muttering in a language Vilgrim doesn't know.
Vilgrim weighs his choices. He sneaks back, placing his hand carefully in Ganraz's to alert him of his presence. He tells Ganraz what's up, then sneaks back into the chamber to sneak attack the necromancer.
He stops behind the necromancer, holding his rapier, and stabs sharply, dealing 26 damage. It would have pierced the heart, but the shadows swirling around the necromancer shift him slightly at the last moment. As his invisibility spell drops, Vilgrim yells, "NOW!"

{h]Roll initiative}
Turn order: Aleya, Brande, Vilgrim, Angelo, Ganraz
Aleya dashes past the ogre. It tries to take an attack of opportunity, and it has sentinel, but it rolls a nat 1 so that's perfect. She rushes at the necromancer, dealing 7 slashing damage and 6 fire damage. He's looking pretty pissed off.
Brande, seeing this big beastie, decides to do the smart thing and avoid him. He tries to shoot at the necromancer, but his arrow gets eaten up by the shadows.
The necromancer glares at Aleya, snarling, "You dare try to disturb my work?" He uses Shadow Blast, dealing 10 damage to Aleya and knocking her back 15 feet.
It's the ogre's turn. Oh shit oh fuck. It tries to attack Aleya, but 16 doesn't hit, so fuck yes.
Vilgrim aims at the eye socket of the ogre, dealing 17 damage, but it doesn't seem to react except.
A cloud of daggers flies from Angelo's palm, swirling in between the ogre and Aleya. It deals 10 damage, leaving nicks and cuts across its skin. He then casts Bardic Inspiration on Aleya, inspiring her to get the fuck back up.
Ganraz charges forwards, slashing at the necromancer, but the shadows force him backwards.
Aleya slips past the ogre, slashing at the necromancer and dealing 16 damage. The ogre takes 3 fire damage. Green light carves through the shadow, and Aleya yells at Vilgrim, "Get the girl!" The ogre, with that stupid sentinel shit, gets to attack Aleya. She is on one hit point. Holy shit.
Brande is next. He glances at the cage Elise is in, and sees that it would open from the top. He yells to Vilgrim, "I've got the girl!" He gets to the cage, slashing at the lock with his scimitar. It deals 10 damage, shattering the lock.

{[h]We got a cutscene}
Kar'vun has blood dripping from beneath his robes, and shadows stream off of him. He sees Brande shatter the lock and reach for the girl. He looks back at the sarcophagus, and mutters under his breath, "It was not supposed to be like this. I need more time." He takes a step back, and Ganraz tries to attack. The necromancer casts shield. He then steps up to the sarcophagus, offering his arm as a sacrifice. Everything from the elbow down drops into the shadows.
A gauntleted hand reaches out of the sarcophagus, and a warrior in black armour rises from the darkness. Kar'vun is pleased, until that gauntleted hand catches him by the throat. Kar'vun realises, a bit too late, that this might have been a bad plan.
Milky white tendrils spill from beneath the armoured figure's armour, slamming into Kar'vun. His body shrivels, and that boi is dead.
The ogre drops when the necromancer does.

{[h]Wew lad, we're in the second stage of the boss battle}
The undead knight steps forwards, slashing at Ganraz. He parries it, but an ethereal tentacle snaps out, dealing 7 points of damage, and Ganraz is grappled.
Angelo casts Vicious Mockery on the undead knight. He says in Elvish, "I won't waste my best insults on you, because you wouldn't understand them." The sheer arrogance of that remark transcends the undead knight's comprehension, dealing 4 psychic damage. Angelo then casts Healing Word on Aleya, giving her 8hp back.
Ganraz uses Distracting Strike, knocking it off balance.
Aleya attacks, dealing 15 damage. Her blade carves through the breast plate.
Brande reaches into the cage, grabbing Elise, and pulling her out of the cage. He hurries away from the cage, towards Vilgrim.
Vilgrim puts himself between Brande and the undead knight, but his arrow glances off the armour.
The undead knight slashes at Aleya, but she casts Shield. It then tries to use Life Drain on Ganraz. Dealing 26 damage. Ganraz has one hp left, shit shit shit.
Angelo casts Vicious Mockery on the Death Knight, shouting, "Leave them alone, you son of a mongrel!" He deals 3 psychic damage, bruising the Death Knight's ego.
Ganraz commands Vilgrim to shoot now. He does so, dealing 17 damage.
Aleya slashes at the Death Knight, dealing 8 damage. She shouts at the rest of the party, "Take the girl and go!"
Brande hurries past, ordering Angelo to make sure the others get out as well.
Angelo is conflicted and, obeying Aleya's instruction first, steps to follow Brande. He stops, hisses, "fuck" and then runs back into the room, casting Healing Word on Ganraz and giving him 10 hp back. He then casts Vicious Mockery again, distracting the Death Knight by shouting, "Your mother was a goblin!" 3 psychic damage.
Ganraz manages to fight his way free of the tendrils, backing away.
Aleya's blade hums as she slashes at the Death Knight, slicing clean through its spinal column and decapitating it in one clean slice. (15 damage)

{[h]Post-battle fatigue}
Aleya crumples to one knee, asking Ganraz how he is. Ganraz doesn't answer, slumping back against the pillar and catching his breath.
Angelo approaches, and admits he's exhausted, he can't use any magic at the moment to heal either of them. He does glance at the tattered ends of his cloak, and offers to cut off some strips for them to use as bandages. They thank him but refuse.
Angelo: Ok, well, I'm not going to offer again, I'm not that nice.
Brande checks on Lady Elise, and she appears to be unhurt. She just seems to be sleeping. He gets the impression that it's an effect of magic.
Angelo inspects the Death Knight's armour. It's well-made, but it's obviously old. The sword has been treated to appear black, and Angelo finds engravings on the back of the breast plate. He discreetly pulls out his black book, drawing them in for later reference.
Ganraz gets up and limps towards the entrance.
Vilgrim inspects the body by the sarcophagus. He finds 2 potions, 5 platinum, and a large topaz. He then inspects the area, with Angelo giving advantage. He can tell that this was supposed to be Usak Vaal, and there's a slot for something. It seems strange to him.
Aleya: Help me up…
Angelo: Of course. (He does so) Would you like an arm to help you walk?
Aleya: You know what…. Feel free, why not.
Angelo: You've surprised me. Does this mean we are starting to become friends?
Aleya: I wouldn't go that far.
Angelo: Fair enough. I must warn you, this is two favours you owe me now, as this is the second time I've helped you. I will keep count.
Ganraz makes it outside, taking in a deep breath. A wolf appears, and Gareth shifts back into his normal shape. He asks what the fuck happened, and Ganraz briefly explains.
Upon Aleya's recommendation, Vilgrim runs to get the needed object from Ganraz. He runs back, putting the disc in the slot. The statue slides back, revealing a slope. Angelo says straight away that it's a terrible idea to go that way. Aleya and Vilgrim ignore him, heading off to investigate, a badly limping Aleya leading the way.
They discover what appears to be a tomb, containing 5 sarcophagi. They seem to be perfectly preserved. Aleya immediately warns Vilgrim to not touch anything. As they respectfully enter, a spectral figure appears. It's the same ghost from before.
It stands beside the hilt of a sword, and looks at Aleya. He bows his head, and she hears a voice in her head saying, "You defeated the despoilers. You may be worthy."
She turns to Vilgrim, and tells him to be ready to leave if something goes down. She then approaches the hilt, and carefully touches it. As soon as she does, she sees visions of that battle; she can see the bugbear from the statue cut down her commander, and she feels fear, and then it relaxes, calming, and she feels more in control. Vilgrim sees Aleya close her eyes, and then a blade of pure white light appears from the hilt, and the vanishes again.
Aleya opens her eyes. She's a bit shaken, not sure what to think of what just happened. But nothing bad has technically happened, so she keeps hold of the sword hilt.
We all regroup at the camp Gareth has made up, settling down for the rest of the night.
Vilgrim checks out the ring; it's an adrenaline ring, and he decides to give it to Ganraz. Unlike Angelo, Vilgrim doesn't expect any favours in return.
And that's the end of the session. We are now level 5, and we get a long rest.

`{[h]Outside the tomb of Usak Vaal and the Knights of Order}
We begin this session in a camp set up by Gareth. We bring him up to speed.
Brande is sitting by the fire, and pulls out a black glass flute. He lights a flame in the chamber, and the heat makes a tune. Angelo is sitting slightly away from the rest of the group, making notes in his regular journal. Ganraz essentially passes out.
Aleya goes over to Vilgrim, thanking him for his help. At this moment, he feels a slight warmth in his satchel, and receives a message. DUN DUN DUN sekrits.
She goes off a little way, sitting with the hilt she just received in her lap, so that she can attune to it. Although it's not ornate, it is well made, and gives her a sense of resolve.
Gareth feels a sense of tranquillity coming from the reflection of the moons over the lake. He hasn't felt this calm in a while.
Both Gareth and Dio Brando take first watch.

{[h]Ruh roh}
Gareth rolls a 9 on his perception. It's a clear night, so he gets a chance to take in the beauty around him. He thinks he's paying attention.
Brande rolls a 24, keeping a very alert watch with his bow in hand. He pictures what this area could have been like, after having seen that mural in the tomb. It's quiet, and he finds himself drawn to looking into the fire. He closes his eyes, and when he opens them again, he is in complete darkness, and everything's gone.
He summons a flame to his hand, like he normally would, but this flame is bright white and surprisingly warm. Another appears. Then another. Then everything lights up with white, orange and blue flame, surrounding him. He shields his eyes, but it's so bright that it makes no difference.
He can't make out the form that appears before him, but he can discern a vague outline in the light; flaming wings unfurl. A voice emerges from the dark.
"You have done well. But there are many more trials that you must face. A great threat arises from the mountains to the north."
There are apparently forces preventing this being from intervening. (Writer's translation: If this bitch gets involved, it'll be too easy for you, so get fukd kids you gotta do it yourself, it'll be good for you I promise)
This being asks if Brande will be an agent for it [Scribe Note: I heard its name as Tina Sorei, and I can't bring myself to actually call it that]. Brande is loyal, so he's granted the power of the ultimate fire magic. Aw shiiit. His bow catches ablaze, burning and turning to ash, and then it's gone.

{[h]The night continues}
He opens his eyes, and he's staring at the fire. His bow is gone.
Gareth turns around and sees Brande's bow missing and a sort of glassy stare.
Gareth: You ok there?
Brande: Yes, I am very much ok.
Gareth: eyyy, that's good
Brande explains to him that for his people, fire and the soul are one and the same. Gareth accepts that. Their watch comes to an end.
Brande wakes Angelo, and Vilgrim returns from his sneaky boi thing.
Angelo and Vilgrim roll an 18 and 22 respectively. It's getting a bit colder now. Things are pretty uneventful until Elise sits up suddenly, startling both Angelo and Vilgrim. Vilgrim asks how much she remembers. Elise can remember the fight and being grabbed, and there was a small cloaked figure. Vilgrim fills her in on events missed, and she looks around. She feels a bit guilty at how much trouble we've gone to.
She tells us we have the favour and protection of House Cristole. She seems to have fought off whatever magical sleep was upon her. She does eventually fall asleep after eating and having some water. Angelo drapes his side cape over her, and then makes his way over to the fire to make some notes in his black book. As Vilgrim joins him, he immediately snaps his black book shut again and puts it away.

{[h]In the morning}
A low mist hangs over the lake, but it's a pretty clear day.
Brande and Angelo both wake up a little earlier; Brande goes off by himself to check his flame again. It appears as it normally does. None of his efforts to change it or make it more powerful like it was last night doesn't do anything.
He misses his bow.
Luckily, thinking about the bow summons it into being; it looks blackened and charred, but it's an-honest-to-Olsinger bow. He focuses on it again, and in a curl of smoke it is gone. He rejoins the group. As he turns back to the party, he sees everyone lit up, appearing as silhouettes of pure flame, except for Lady Elise.
Aleya goes down to the lake to have a bath. It is very cold.
Lady Elise asks Angelo how long he thinks it'll take them to get back. He tells her about a day and a half, and she points out that her shoes aren't exactly the best for long walks. He assures her that the group will be willing to accommodate her and won't sprint off.

{[h]On the march}
Brande leads, rolling well on his survival checks, so we make it down the slope quite easily. The morning warms up a bit, and we catch up to Aleya down by the lake.
Dio Brando gets us a little bit lost in the forest and we try to find where we came out of the treeline. We're about an hour behind now, but it's not a major concern. He does manage to find the path again.
The day's travel is about 9 hours, but we're back to the site where we first camped. It's about 4:30pm in the afternoon.
Lady Elise hasn't complained once, and as is her character she hasn't spoken much. Ganraz asks her if she would like to camp. She admits to being a little tired, but is happy to continue if that's what Ganraz thinks is best. We continue for a bit, following a trail so no need for survival checks.
There's slightly more grassland now. It's approaching sunset.

{[h]Making camp}
Brande and Aleya collect firewood, and Gareth lights it using flaming sphere. Brande comments that Gareth can't really control his flame. A debate about size over skill begins.
Brande and Ganraz take the first watch. 16 and 23. Brande notices something moving in the nearby undergrowth; Ganraz has seen it as well, and both of them tense. It's a fox, padding towards the direction we just came from. There are also some small birds.
Ganraz noticed that there was a definite absence of animal life during the day's travel, and now they seem to be returning to the area.
Brande comments that he will never get used to the cold nights in Breland. Ganraz asks where he's from. Brande is from the Blade Desert, though Ganraz hasn't been that far afield. Brande admits that his people don't normally travel that far either, and that it was mostly visions that convinced him to travel. He's following the word of his deity. Ganraz accepts that, much like Gareth. Brande fires the question back at him. Ganraz explains that he's travelling with the caravan mostly as an alliance of convenience, rather than being on a god's quest to defend his homeland.
Gareth's watch is uneventful.
Angelo and Aleya take last watch, and both roll pretty high. There's definitely a return of wildlife. We also both notice that the backs of her ankles are heavily blistered, and hadn't said anything about it. The other thing we notice as the light comes up that the area we are in is nothing but rolling green hills. It's much less rocky; we have arrived in the Elsir Vale.
As she starts to wake up, Angelo scolds her for not telling him that she was hurting, even though she was walking right next to him. He casts Healing Word on her feet, giving her 8hp back, and then they bind her feet with bandages to stop the rubbing. She then asks if he might have a hairbrush, and Angelo provides her a comb. Aleya laughs a little at how Elise fusses over her looks/Angelo having a comb on him.
As we leave, Angelo insists that Elise tell him if she experiences any discomfort, she should tell him immediately. She agrees, and asks for his last name. He answers with Soliloquy, which she finds unusual. She then asks him if he knows any good stories to pass the time. He rolls an 11 on performance, but he's got that sweet +10, so everyone is actually kind of interested in this fairy tale/fable he tells her.
As we walk, we notice a figure coming towards us. Aleya says that we're not expecting company. Ganraz points out that it's only one person, so they're probably not a massive threat to us. It's also a path, so we're probably not the only ones using it.
It's ok, our suspicion was not necessary; as we get closer, we find Seamus leaning against the rocks, sipping from a flask of tea. He asks if we're all safe, and checks in one Elise. Itaan sent him ahead to keep an eye out for us. He claps Angelo on the back, as he's closest.
We notice that the metal banding on Seamus' arm is now on both. It looks like it should be a wound in the skin, but is instead fused perfectly to the arm. He's got some upgrades.
Aleya notices a sparkle from the nearby trees. She immediately backs up, putting herself between the attackers and Elise.

{[h]Another ambush, my dudes}
Initiative order: Brande, Aleya, Seamus, Angelo, Gareth, Vilgrim, Ganraz
Enemies: Orange hobgoblin, purple hobgoblin, pink hobgoblin, red hobgoblin, blue hobgoblin, green hobgoblin
Brande is up first, summing a flame to his palm and firing three Scorching Rays. He fires two at orange boi, and one at purple boi. He deals 7 fire damage to orange boi.
Aleya moves up, casting Thunderwave on both orange and purple hobgoblins. She deals 18 damage to orange, and 9 to purple. Orange boi flies backwards, and we hear bones crunching. He dead.
Seamus activates his arm, casting Firebolt at the purple boi. It flies at him but glances off his shield.
Hobgoblins go next. The red attacks Brande but misses. Blue attacks Ganraz but misses. Green attacks Gareth and deals 16 damage. Purple and pink attack Aleya. Both attacks miss.
A large wolf pads into view. Brande recognises it as a hellhound. He's well aware that they can breathe fire, and warns the party.
Angelo casts Vicious Mockery on the purple boi. "It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level." Blood trickles from the corner of his mouth, and he collapses, dead. He then inspires Ganraz, and backs up, keeping Elise behind him. Elise takes the dodge action, hiding behind Angelo.
Gareth moves around the back of the green goblin, casting Thunderwave. Out of the three, green is killed instantly. Ganraz is also caught in the damage, taking 13 damage like green did and gets thrown backwards. Both red and blue save.
Vilgrim shouts to Brande, "Watch out!", and shoots through his legs to hit red. He gets sneak attack damage, dealing 15 total. The red hobgoblin is definitely dead. He then moves backwards to also guard Elise.
We see a figure in a cloak and scale mail armour jog round the corner after the hellhound. He smiles as he sees the fight going on, but can see it isn't going the way he wants it to. He draws two swords, twirling them, and dashes up towards us.
Ganraz charges the blue hobgoblin and attacks, but an 18 doesn't hit. Oh boi. Oh no. He parries Ganraz' blade. He moves towards the big bad boi, and the blue hobgob's attack doesn't really hit. The figure seems pleased that Ganraz would challenge him. Foolishly, he wasn't expecting Ganraz's might, and our boi deals 9 slashing damage, and the next person to attack him has advantage.
Brande is up again as we start a new round. He strikes the blue hobgoblin, but the first misses. The second hits, dealing 8 damage and killing him.
Five more hobgoblins spill around the corner, and they seem to be surrounding a robed hobgoblin. It casts Bless on the hellhound and two of the hobgoblins that came with him.
Aleya moves forwards. She rolls a nat 20 as she attacks the scale armoured hobgoblin and the red hobgoblin. 22 force damage and 12 fire damage on the armoured hobgoblin, and 11 fire damage on the red hobgoblin. Red boi is dead for sure.
Seamus casts firebolt at the armoured hobgoblin, but it just misses. He then touches a rune on his arm, charging his axe with lightning magic.
The hellhound dashes forwards, breathing fire at Ganraz, Aleya and Brande. Brande saves, Aleya saves, and Ganraz is on fire. He has to take 23 fire damage. Oh shit. Brande takes 6, Aleya takes 12.
Angelo casts Vicious Mockery on the armoured hobgoblin, saying "Oh… something scathing" And dealing 6 psychic damage. He then casts bardic inspiration on Aleya, and turns to Elise. "If this goes badly, you and I are running. Do you understand me?" She nods.
Gareth moves back a bit, casting Call Lightning. A cloud materialises in the sky, and a bolt of lightning strikes the party of advancing hobgoblins. He deals 12 damage to the purple hobgoblin 2, killing it instantly. Orange 2 and pink 2 take 6 damage each.
Vilgrim tells Angelo and Elise to stay safe, and then Naruto runs into the forest stealthily. He fires at the hellhound, dealing 14 damage. It looks pretty annoyed, but turns back to Aleya and the others.
The armoured hobgoblin attacks Ganraz twice. The first attack misses, but the second deals 6 damage. He takes another two attacks, and the first misses again, but the second hits, dealing 5 damage. "Do you think you can dance with me?"
"I'll show you how to dance." Ganraz is next, so he takes a swing, dealing 10 slashing damage. He then moves around the back of him, taking another swing, but the armoured hobgoblin parries that one. He uses second wind to get some hp back, and takes the dodge action.
Brande moves to the left, using Shatter to hit the green, orange, blue and pink hobgoblins. His attack deals 11 thunder damage, killing the green and orange hobgoblins, and dealing 6 damage to the other two.
The cleric hobgoblin goes next, casting Toll the Dead on Ganraz. He takes 8 necrotic damage.
Pink and blue hobgoblins attack Ganraz but both miss.
The second hellhound tries to breath fire at Brande and Aleya. Aleya fails her dex save, but Brande succeeds. Aleya takes 9 damage, and Brande takes 5.
Aleya circles the armoured hobgoblin, and deals 14 force damage and 1 thunder damage. She then action surges and makes another attack, but it glances off his armour. He's looking pretty rough, and trying to keep an eye on both Ganraz and Aleya.
Seamus charges at the armoured hobgoblin, slashing with his axe and dealing 8 slashing and 6 lightning damage. He does yell for Aleya to move out the way, but she can't hear him, so he runs and jumps, slashing downwards and embedding his axe through the collarbone of the armoured hobgoblin.
The hellhound gets his breath attack back. Joy. It uses it against Seamus and Aleya. Thanks to bardic inspiration, Aleya does save, so they both take 6 damage.
Angelo casts Major Image, setting up what looks like a wall of fire spell between Ganraz and the blue and pink hobgoblins, and the second hellhound. He shouts at Ganraz to put distance between himself and the others, and inspires Brande.
Gareth casts his lightning spell again, dealing 24 damage total.
Vilgrim takes a moment to process seeing all of the elements raining down on the area. Then he darts to hide in the trees.
Ganraz sees the wall of fire before him, and decides he doesn't much care for Angelo's distraction tactic. So he just runs around the thing meant to protect him, and charges at the cleric hobgoblin. He takes the dodge action.
Brande also ignore the wall of flame before him, attacking the second hellhound, but misses.
The blue hobgoblin, pink hobgoblin and cleric all try to attack Ganraz, but he's not having any of that shit.
Aleya also moves around the flames, uses green flame blade, dealing 12 force and 7 fire damage to the blue and the pink takes 8 fire damage.
Seamus moves forwards, readying his action to attack.
Seeing that his perfect distraction didn't work, Angelo drops his major image, resigned. He casts Healing Word on Ganraz, giving him 9 hp back, and then casts Vicious Mockery on the hellhound, dealing 6 psychic damage.
Gareth strikes the ground with lightning once again, dealing 15 and 9 damage.
Vilgrim is still a sneaky boi, so he shoots at the hellhound but misses.
Ganraz swings at the cleric, dealing 6 damage. He then shouts Vilgrim's name, using Commander's Strike. Vilgrim shoots at the cleric, dealing 30 damage. His arrow sinks into his throat, cutting off whatever he was about to say in goblinoid.
Brande is up next, dealing 9 slashing damage. The hellhound is still alive. His second attack misses.
The hellhound is next. It's pretty pissed off. It uses its breath weapon on Brande, which means it's reduced to 6. Angelo reduces it further by using Cutting Words, so it's now 1.
Aleya is next. She deals 17 damage, when it only had 1hp, cleaving it in half.

{[h]Combat's over, time to loot}
Ganraz unbuckles his shield, marching towards Gareth and punches him in the nose. He deals 4 points of bludgeoning damage, knocking him to the ground. Ganraz warns him, "Next time you cast any shit on me, without any warning, I will kill you." He helps him up.
Brande casts Detect Magic, sensing two sources of magic from the armoured hobgoblin, and two from the cleric as well. The potion is healing, and the armour is abjuration. Aleya is also investigating the cleric. He's got a potion, a mace, and a strange pendant around his neck. Five barbs, each painted a different colour.
Seamus investigates the armoured hobgoblin. He's got money on him, and two nice swords. He asks if anyone would want the swords. One has abjuration on it, showing no signs of wear.
The regular hobgoblins all wield regular longswords, steel shields and chainmail.
Aleya tosses the cleric's pendant to Angelo to see if he knows anything. He knows that there are five types of chromatic dragons, red, blue, green, black, white. In the first age of Eberron, there were believed to be powerful entities known as Overlords who were cast out of this world somehow. This symbol is reminiscent to Tiamat, associated with dragons. He relays this to Aleya, and then decides to hang onto it.
Inside the house, we find bodies, three humans and one half elf, all male. They've been dumped unceremoniously. On the table, there's some armour, light crossbows, and longswords. Distributed amongst the sacks are some gold. 150 to Ganraz and 150 to Aleya.
Aleya takes an opportunity to sit down, looking a bit shaken after being burned. Brande casts Lay on Hands, giving her 10hp back.
We can see the smoke of campfires in the distance; Drellin's Ferry is close by.`

{[h]After that most recent ambush}
The red hand on the hobgoblin shields is not a symbol even Angelo has seen before, despite a 16 history check. Ganraz remarks that they were very well organised, almost like soldiers. Brande and Aleya agree.
Gareth kicks a pile of formerly-hellhound-ash, asking Brande if he knows what they were. He does, letting us know they're hellhounds. Angelo doesn't know much about hellhounds, but he knows that entities attuned to the elements, like them, generally roam in deserts like where Brande comes from.
Brande recognises the red hand on the shield, but he doesn't know what it means.
Seamus wants to inspect the anatomy of the corpses. Everyone stops for a moment to question the weird way he asked for that investigation check. Ganraz's player runs away, hoping to return when the conversation's over. There's a human male, mid 40s, with a broken neck. A male half elf, relatively finely dressed, who has two stab wounds. Two leather armoured have burn wounds. It seems like they were all killed relatively quickly.
Brande checks the armoured hobgoblin. He's got lots of little scars from previous battles.
Lady Elise asks Angelo why those people were attacking us. He admits that he's not sure, because he doesn't recognise the symbols on the shields, but he thinks that once we reach our destination things should be much quieter. She then asks Seamus if he was sent by Itaan, which he confirms. She says they should carry on, but Angelo stops her, and checks on how her feet are doing again. Insists once again that she tell him if she's hurting. She admits it might be nice if we take a couple of breaks. Seamus helps out by using his artificer witchcraft to bolster her shoes and give her that sweet ankle support. Badass.
As we walk along, Ganraz falls in line with Seamus, asking if maybe he could help to sort out his pretty banged up armour. It's a small favour to ask, and a man of Seamus' skill could fix it up in about half an hour. He quickly casts the Mending cantrip as a quick fix, and then promises to work properly on it later.

{[h]Drellin's Ferry }
A sleepy town unfolds before us. There are six pillars across the river, which might have once held a bridge, but it's long gone. Instead there are ropes to pull a ferry across to the far bank. On the other side we can see the caravan, the camps all set up.
A group of four armed townsfolk await us. The one in chainmail asks us to halt, but recognises Seamus. We let them know we're escorting the Lady Elise, and they immediately have no problem with us.
Ganraz and Aleya let them know about the hobgoblins that attacked us, and also that the people in the farmhouse were killed. He recognises the farmer, and says he'll send a few boys over to bury the dead. Aleya advises they might want to send more than a few. He thanks us for the heads up. There have been sightings of other raiding hobgoblins, mostly to the north, which is why they posted more guards. He points us in the direction of a large stone building, letting us know that that's where the guard-captain is.
He also recommends The Old Bridge Inn as a place to get a drink. The caravan is on the other side of the river. The guard's name is Hersk.
As we enter the town, we can see some faces that we recognise from the caravan. A group of children surround two that we recognise.
As we're deciding what to do, (although we're most likely going to the tavern) we spot Jast, Hardag and Edd. Only Aleya notices that Jast looks like he's had a few drinks already. Jast offers to take Lady Elise back to Markos/Itaan, but Aleya says Angelo can manage to do it.
Angelo plans to take Lady Elise back, whilst Aleya, Brande, Ganraz and Seamus decide to go to the tavern. Angelo says he'll catch up once he's got his violin.
There are guards at the crossing, and spot Angelo and Elise approaching. A man comes out of a small hut next to it, and is surprised when he hears that the guards are letting us through with no charge. This is Drathgar – the great-grandnephew of Drellin himself.
We reach the other side without having to pay.
There's a provisions shop, (Steryl's Provisioning?). We make it to a large tent, and recognise Markos.
Markos: You took your damn time, but you're a sight for sore eyes. And it's not just because you're pretty.
Angelo: I missed you too.
Elise asks to see Itaan, and Markos guides us to the big tent marked with the green of House Cristole. Itaan is very pleased to see her alive and well. Itaan thanks Angelo, and asks if there's anything he can do. Angelo has no need for thanks, but information is more important to him; he asks about the pendant he picked up from the cleric before. Angelo gets out his black book to make notes on what Itaan says.
The talisman is usually associated with Tiamat, an evil being; linked to power, greed, pride, inherent in draconic entities. Dragons haven't been seen on the continent of Khorvaire for millennia. Overlords. Unkillable. Lots of bad shit, basically. It was bound by the Silver Flame (according to the Church of the Silver Flame). He says that the pendant doesn't have any magical properties, but he has heard cults pop up every now and again. Angelo asks about the red hand, but Itaan doesn't recognise it. When Angelo tells him he got the pendant from a hobgoblin cleric, Itaan is surprised, thinking it bizarre. Angelo thanks him for the time, and apologises for keeping him up for ages. He then tells Elise to come to him directly if she needs anything.
He then hurries back to the wagon where Vilgrim and he had stored their extra stuff and finds Vilgrim already there, petting Jastiz. Angelo is mildly annoyed to bump into Vilgrim after his short-lived freedom, but resignedly tells him that we're all meeting in the tavern whilst he grabs his violin. He then runs to catch up with the rest of the party.

{[h]TAVERN SHENANIGANS}
The rest of the party enter the tavern. It's a bit chaotic, crammed full of people. They can hear what sounds like someone playing darts upstairs, there's a bard in the corner, and people playing cards. Ganraz spots a table about to become free, so he orders Seamus and Brande to grab it whilst he and Aleya grab the drinks.
A halfling bartender rushes up to serve them, standing on the bar, asking if they're there to cause trouble. When they say they're not, he's more than happy to serve us. Aleya asks for 10 Drellin's Thirst, whilst Ganraz gets a bottle of the fancy Cryan red wine, which is 10 gold for the bottle, and a bottle of house wine. Ganraz just got gold and he's happy to spend it. The bartender, deciding he likes us, introduces himself as Kellin Shadowbanks. Ganraz also asks if there's any rooms free.
The party are confused at this spending spree. Ganraz's player tells us to wait and see. Ganraz is playing some sort of long con.
As the drinks arrive at the table, Angelo arrives too. He asks what the party ordered, and Aleya answers with "everything". He's impressed, and even more impressed with Ganraz' taste in wine when the bottles come out.
Brande asks what's good to drink, and Aleya gives him whiskey. He drinks it, and he's not used to feeling burning sensations but this burns, strangely. Angelo asks him how it was. "Unusual." He tells Brande to have another.
We hear roaring and cheering from another table, and Hardag stands up, having just won an arm wrestling contest. Jast stands and asks if anyone is going to challenge him. Aleya gets up, mug of ale in hand. Angelo asks Ganraz if he'll bet two silvers. Angelo is in favour of Aleya, and Ganraz favours Hardag.
They both roll a 23 for the first round, and there's no movement between either of them.
There is a lot of back and forth, and there's a serious contest for 10 solid minutes. Neither Aleya or Hardag are giving. Angelo casts his last bardic inspiration on Aleya, shouting, "I've got money riding on you, don't you dare give up now. I've seen what you can do in battle!"
At the last minute, she manages to slam down Hardag's hand. Angelo wins two silver in his bet with Ganraz.
Jast asks if anyone would challenge the new champion. Ganraz says he will. Whilst Angelo is explaining what bets are to Brande, Ganraz manages to beat and exhausted Aleya.
We all sit back down around the table, and Ganraz says that after having fought together, we should get to know each other. There's a collective groan at this.
Aleya goes first, explaining how she's just here because it's a job. Brande is very drunk by this point, and starts trying to preach the wonders of Tine Siorai. Aleya and Angelo are groaning into their hands. Angelo is asked next, and he says something vague about everyone needing to make some coin in order to survive. Aleya rolls an insight check, but nothing can beat Angelo's roll of 30 deception.
[Scribe note: Fuck, I missed a lot of backstory notes here, because Aleya sent a message to Angelo, asking him some sekrit things. There are too many things to type.]
It's like 10pm in game now, and Ganraz asks if there's any drinking competitions going on. Brande sees a group and shuffles over to them, and asks what the game is. It's dwarven roulette. The dwarf explains that the game involves 6 mugs, and then he pulls his cock out and pisses in one of them. The piss mug is mug 3. Everyone else is watching this go down. Brande, after having learned what bets are 5 minutes ago, slams down a gold piece on the table.
Brande picks up mug 4. The dwarf picks up mug 1.
Brande picks up mug 6. The dwarf picks up mug 2.
Brande picks up mug 3. He looks the dwarf dead in the eye, drinks, and immediately spits it out.
He loses his gold piece, but is given 5 silver for being entertaining.
As he comes back to the table, Robin comes down the stairs juggling daggers. She says she's glad to see us alive, and it's a shame we missed her knife act. We all roll to see if we're drunk – Brande is hammered, and Aleya's pretty drunk now too, but Ganraz and Angelo have kept their wits about them, and Seamus wasn't heavily drinking.
Aleya head to the graveyard, and finds the headstone of an unknown soldier. She falls to her knees in front of it, lays the greatsword in front of it and has a good old cry.
We return to camp.

{[h]In the morning}
[Mol 9 Eyre]
As we're getting up, Aleya quickly does some shopping. Then we see some armour-clad guards and a red-haired woman in plate armour approaching the camp, escorting a guy in nobleman's clothes.
He asks for the adventurers who saved Lady Elise. Angelo doesn't recognise him. His name is Speaker Noro(?) Winston. The woman with him is the guard-captain. He says that they have problems, and that maybe we can help. Hobgoblin raiders have been harrying their land for a while now.
The guard-captain says that bands of hobgoblins seem to be gathering for a raid. The Speaker is willing to pay us 600 gold each to repel the attackers and drive them away from Drellin's Ferry. We're told they may be centres around a keep in the witchwood. The guards are stretched thin, so if an attack came then they might not be able to protect all the refugees.
Aleya agrees, as does Brande, and when Vilgrim agrees, saying he has business here that he wants to investigate, Angelo also agrees to help. Ganraz also agrees, when he arrives. The ruin is 15 miles west. As long as the hobgoblins remain, the refugees aren't necessarily safe.
Aleya goes to study her spellbook, casting Comprehend Languages in order to do so. Brande goes to Itaan to help identify the potions he's picked up. Angelo is also in the tavern, writing in both his black book and his journal. Aleya notices this, but he's chosen to sit far enough away from her so that she can't read what he's writing. Ganraz receives a message. None of us (even out of character) know what it is. He does some shopping after Seamus fixes up his armour.
We start packing up our things, getting ready to delve into the witchwood. We've definitely had a long rest (and some of us have had a long hangover).`

{[h]The session begins}
Aleya and Ganraz do some shopping and sort out provisions. Aleya and Angelo are chilling in the tavern. Vilgrim goes to get some food from Just Eat for Jastiz.
Whilst it's just Angelo and Aleya in the tavern, he asks her for a favour. He asks if she could maybe tell him the next time she wants to use her detection magic, to let him know that she's using it. He asks her if she could detect any magic on the locket he wears around his neck. She can tell it's a personal item because of how he handles it, and because of it being so close to him and concealed. She can't detect any magic on it, which disappoints Angelo. She can pick up enchantment on him, and some enchantment on Kellen the barkeep. She awkwardly apologises when he's disappointed, and he says it's fine.
We make our way to the ferry, and meet Guard Captain Surana (?) and a warforged. The warforged is gunmetal black/grey, and one of their arms is actually a retractable spike arm. The guard captain introduces them as Alpha. She says that they've been an asset in scouting for goblins etc. She gives us our provisions; apples, cheeses, cured meats, stuff that will last a long time and not spoil.
When Aleya and Ganraz ask about travel, the guard captain tells us that the Dawn Way is generally safe. [Scribe note: "Generally" is the key word] There are some wolves and things when we get further into the witchwood. She tells us that if we need more info on beasts and things, we should ask Jorr the hunter.
Some of the group have seen warforged before, particularly Seamus. He recognises that a model like Alpha would have been made within the last three years of the war. Aleya notices this too, and asks what they were built for. They were built for infiltration. Vilgrim is incredibly suspicious. Angelo asks him if he has dagger envy. Brande has literally no idea what Alpha is. When asked, they reply, "A skirmisher." It doesn't answer the question for Brande but he just smiles and nods. When Aleya asks who made Alpha, they reply "House Cannith."
Vilgrim's glares quadruple. Angelo's ears also prick up at this news.
Ganraz knows that House Cannith is still about. Angelo knows that House Cannith had many bases of operations. He knows that they had one in Breland for sure, and two more, but the rest he's not sure of. Vilgrim knows basically the same thing.
The sneaky gnome sidles up to Alpha and offers his hand to shake. Don't trust him he's got a knife. Alpha risks it and shakes his hand. He gives them a quick once-over, trying to determine more details about them.
As we're getting ready to go, two familiar figures approach us. One is Jhen, the best boi, and the other is Robin. They are both armed, and Robin smiles at us. She asks where we're off to. We inform her, and she tells us that both she and Jhen will be scouting around within the woods somewhere. Brande challenges her to a shooting match when we get back, and she tells us that she prefers throwing daggers. He's welcome to try and challenge her, although everyone (including Jhen) is pretty sure that she'll win.

{[h]Entering the forest}
As we begin our journey, Brande summons his bow. Most of us haven't seen him do this before, so Aleya asks about it. Gareth and Brande lead the way, rolling pretty well on their survival checks. After about two or three hours, the trees give way to a slightly more boggy area.
We all roll perception. Some of us do ok. Every few miles or so we notice rudimentary huts and stuff, old woodcutter cabins. Pretty much every building we find is abandoned. Aleya and Ganraz check out the buildings to see if there's anyone inside. It looks like the homes have been vacated rather than any forceful evictions. They were probably abandoned around the same time that the hobgoblins came into the area.
Brande and Gareth roll another survival, and we lose the path in a couple of places, but even after being slowed down by bog for about an hour, we arrive at a cabin. From the looks of it, with the fishing baskets, skinning frame, and various pelts, this is probably Jorr's cabins.
Ganraz goes to knock on the door. Gareth sneaks around to the side, to try and peek into the outhouse. As he does so, his foot snaps a twig, and he hears a loud growling. Then two mastiffs lunge for him, but are snapped back by chains. This ruins Ganraz' plan to be polite, and stamping feet make their way to the door.
Ganraz talks to Jorr, who appears in the doorway. He asks if Jorr has had any strange visitors recently, but he says no. Ganraz asks if he's noticed any suspicious figures. He says that a townsperson has seen something. Ganraz makes a mental note.
Jorr says he hates goblins. Ganraz tells him that's great, because we're off to kill goblins, and asks if Jorr will be our guide. He agrees, going into his hut and then coming out with a bigger bow and even more pouches.
Aleya asks if he's seen anything bigger than a hobgoblin. He says yes, but not with the hobgoblins. Brande asks if he's seen a symbol, like a red hand. Jorr says yes to this too, having seen a red hand on one of the wargs.
Aleya and Angelo spend five or so minutes explaining what a dog is to Brande. He's never seen a tamed animal/pet, he's used to animals trying to kill him.

{[h]Travelling with Jorr}
Because Jorr rolls a 22 survival, we have no trouble navigating through the woods. After a while, it gets boggier and boggier.
We have to cross a river, and Jorr sends his dogs ahead as scouts. The bridge seems sound, and Jorr says we can cross. As we start to cross, Aleya ties a thread around the edge of the bridge and casts Alarm, to let her know if we're followed.
Angelo notices something wooden in the reeds in the river. He turns to Vilgrim, asking if he's noticed it as well, and Vilgrim can make out that it's a cart. As they see this, a serpentine head snaps out of the water and drags Angelo towards the edge. A second snaps at Alpha, dragging them backwards too.

{[h]Well shit - bridge combat}
{[b]Initiative order:} Brande, Gareth, Ganraz, Seamus, Alpha, Aleya, Angelo, Vilgrim
There are five snek heads total.
Angelo takes 10 damage, Alpha takes 7. Our bois are grappled. As he's being eaten alive, Angelo recognises his killer as a hydra.
Brande fires three scorching rays at the heads, missing twice but dealing 4 fire damage to the head snapped around Angelo.
Gareth uses Primal Savagery, slashing at the hydra head holding Angelo, but the blow glances off of scales. Gareth takes 7 piercing damage from the head snapping at him as he runs away.
Ganraz slashes at the head holding Angelo, dealing 9 damage. He uses his Commander's Strike to get Vilgrim to attack. Vilgrim rolls a 20, so he deals 60 points of damage. The head holding Angelo goes limp.
The next turn would be Seamus, but four more heads emerge from the depths. It's a second, smaller hydra. Hooray. Two heads make two attacks on Seamus and Vilgrim. Seamus takes 28 damage. He is unconscious. Vilgrim takes 21 piercing damage.
Seamus makes a death saving throw, and succeeds.
Alpha snaps their wrist, and from beneath their rapier unsheaths. They deal 16 damage on the head holding their leg. They then shoot it, dealing another 6 damage. The head is still alive, so they are still grappled.
Jorr is next, and he shoots at the hydra. He deals 8 damage, killing the head that had Alpha.
Aleya deals 18 damage to the second hydra.
The second hydra attacks again, but thanks to cutting words Angelo only takes 7 damage.
Angelo disengages, and casts Bardic Inspiration on Ganraz.
Vilgrim shoots at the bigger hydra, dealing 19 damage.
Brande sees Seamus go down, and uses Cure Wounds on him to bring him back up. 14 hp returned to Seamus.
Gareth casts Flaming Sphere on the hydra, dealing 5 damage to one of the heads.
Ganraz is next. His first attack misses, but his second deals 9 damage. Another head goes down. The hydra's looking pretty hurt, and only has two heads left.
The second hydra attacks Brande and Aleya. The first attack on Brande misses, but the second deals 7 damage. Brande uses Hellish Rebuke, dealing 3 points of fire damage. The first attack on Aleya deals 6 points of damage, but the second misses as she uses her shield.
Seamus is awake again, and taps a few runes on his arms. He activates his Barrier. He then casts Firebolt at the two heads attacking Aleya. The attack deals 13 fire damage.
Alpha fires both crossbows at each of the heads left on the big hydra. The first head takes 8 damage, and the second takes 21 damage. That head is dead. Big hydra has only one head left.
Jorr shoots at the remaining hydra head. He deals 14 points of damage. It looks really hurt.
Aleya continues to attack the hydra facing her. She deals 6 damage and obliterates one of the heads.
The big hydra takes a bite at Ganraz. He takes 6 points of piercing damage.
Angelo glares at the hydra that nearly just killed him, and shouts "Back to the pit from whence you came." He deals 6 damage. The hydra's eyes explode and it dies.
Vilgrim rolls yet another 20. He drops to one knee, shooting up at another head, and dealing 32 damage.
The remaining hydra only has two heads left. Brande deals 6 damage, taking out another head.
Gareth drops his flaming sphere, and hurries over to Jorr.
Ganraz sees the hydra in front of him dropping, and turns to help Aleya finish off the last hydra. He deals 20 damage. He drives it through the hydra's final head, and carves it off. The hydra is dead.

{[h]Post combat stuff}
Jorr is surprised by the sight of the hydras. Aleya doubts. She rolls a 13 on her insight. Jorr genuinely seems surprised by their arrival. She still doubts, but Jorr rolls low on his survival checks so he can't say much about anything.
Jorr reckons the hydra skins would fetch a pretty price. Seamus winches in the baby hydra with help from Brande and Alpha.
Brande cuts off some of the hydra's tail, saving some steaks for later. Alpha takes some teeth. Vilgrim and Angelo are watching this happen, very confused.
Jorr says he wants the big hydra too. We don't have weeks to skin this hydra and carry it back, so we say we'll help him drag it onto the bank.
Despite being delirious from bloodloss, Angelo says he'll help Ganraz and Aleya search the cart. He rolls a 1. Can Angelo even see the cart through the blood and mud? Ganraz and Aleya can see there are 6 skeletons, and they seem to be bearing the red hand. One problem solved?
They find some chainmail, and they debate whether Ganraz or Aleya should wear it. They bag it for now. Seamus reckons it would be worth about 300 gold. Aleya has Detect Magic up, so she checks the armour and it has abjuration magic on it.
Jorr reckons it's 2 hours walk to Varth Keep. Alpha pays him 10 gold to thank him for killing the head that had his leg. It'll be 3 hours if we're all sneaky about it and go through the forest. We decide that stealth is the better option.
We roll pretty well on average when it comes to stealth.

{[h]On the way to Varth Keep}
Jorr does a very good job of getting us through the dense forest. We're making good progress, and "you think you're being stealthy" says the dm. Ruh roh.
Ganraz and Angelo roll a 22 on perception. Gareth also rolls high. We can hear the cracking of twigs and heavy footfalls. The sun is setting, so it's getting dark now. Gareth gets the party to stop, and we listen again. A group of six wargs go by, each with a rider.
Ganraz motions for us to stay down and quiet, and we let the warg riders go past. They continue moving, oblivious to us.
Jorr whispers that it's still 40 minutes to the keep. Aleya messages Ganraz, telling him that we're still far away enough from the keep that we'll probably have to deal with those wargs later. He can reply to that message, but he doesn't.
Eventually we reach the end of our journey; the sun is disappearing behind the treeline, and the keep stands before us. It's in very poor repair. A huge humanoid skeleton slumps against the west tower. Angelo rolled a 12 on history, so now he remembers that this keep was destroyed by giants.
Alpha climbs a tree, and can see a thin plume of smoke coming from somewhere within the courtyard.
Ganraz devises a plan. Alpha, Vilgrim and Gareth will act as one group, sneaking into the castle to survey our enemies and then if possible, get the drop on them. The rest of the group will make their way to the wall, and wait for a signal from the scouts. Angelo offers a suggestion to Ganraz; he asks if it would be beneficial to turn Vilgrim and Alpha invisible.
Ganraz: If you can do that, then that would not be helpful – wait I mean –
The party: OK THEN, SIT DOWN ANGELO, DON'T SPEAK TO US EVER AGAIN
We decide to wait for the sun to set a little more, and Gareth rolls perception. There's a couple of guards on the walls. We can spot them every now and again. Aleya warns us that hobgoblins will be very prepared.
As the sun sets, we can see a red glow begin to appear in the top of the broken tower.
The plan remains the same, but we're going to risk splitting the party to give the hobgoblins the illusion of numbers. Ganraz asks Angelo if he can conjure illusions, which the bard confirms. He intends to use Angelo's Wall of Fire illusion to "block" one of the exits. He and Brande will split from the group to the other entrance, whilst Angelo, Aleya and Seamus will remain at the other gate.

{[h]The worst stealth mission in the history of stealth missions}
Gareth casts Jump on Vilgrim, and turns into a spider, but it still has a tiny little beard. Angelo takes Vilgrim and Alpha's hands. The rest of the party see their hands fade into nothing; he's turned both of them invisible.
Vilgrim takes a running jump to get up. He manages to catch the ledge, but some rock falls loose. He manages to catch it, and climbs up. He finds himself in an open room, and a figure is strung up. They appear to be human, but it smells of rot. There's a red light illuminating from below. There's some spiral stairs down, but they appear to be partially blocked.
In the courtyard they can see two more giant skeletons, and some large boulders strewn around the area. We help the DM to build the set out of dice boxes, biscuit boxes and dice, and it looks sick.
Alpha rolls badly on athletics, so they can't see where to climb up. Vilgrim doesn't realise they haven't climbed up, so he starts moving rocks away. When he can't move one of them, he coughs to signal Alpha to help. But Alpha isn't there.
Alpha is struggling. This climbing malarkey is harder than it looks. They're build for infiltration. But not today it seems.
Gareth gives up on them, climbing up the tower to find Vilgrim. He notices the spider with a beard crawling through the window, and asks where Alpha is. Gareth can't talk, because he's a spider.
Alpha has given up on trying to climb, and sneaks in another way. They discover a minotaur in the building that Vilgrim and Gareth can't see yet. The minotaur has a red hand emblazoned on its jet black armour.
Various hijinks ensue as everyone tries to help the dm make the tower that Gareth has discovered. DM can't draw because there's so many props in the way. DM threatens to summon a dragon on us.
Finally, we get to see the inside of the room. Gareth has discovered a bugbear and a hobgoblin. Uh oh.
Vilgrim avoids the minotaur room, because it'll probably be instant death. He instead moves to tuck himself behind a boulder.
Alpha sneaks past the giant skeleton to check out what looks like a stables. They crack the door open a little. There's a manticore inside. They close the door again.

{[h]Let's do this LEEROOOOOOYYYYYY}
Vilgrim sneaks up to one of the guards and shanks him. 34 damage. His Invisibility drops immediately, and the guard drops to the ground, dead.
Alpha tries a door, and sneaks into it.
Angelo feels his spell break, and turns to Aleya to tell her. She immediately messages Ganraz, telling him, "Angelo's spell is broken. You can reply to this message." She drinks the potion of heroism.
Initiative order: Aleya, Gareth, Alpha, Brande, Seamus, Angelo, Vilgrim, Ganraz
Aleya sprints for the gate.
Gareth has no idea what's happening, so he stays still.
Invisibility drops on Alpha, but they aren't deterred. They shoot at the two guards ahead of them. But both attacks miss. They are now very aware that Alpha is there.
Brande runs for the walls, shooting at one of the guards. He deals 12 damage, and kills it.
Seamus runs for the wall, and then runs his fingers down the runes on his arm. He pushes it outwards, casting Enlarge on Aleya. She transforms mid-run, storming towards the gates.
Angelo is next. He runs as far as he can, casting Major Image ahead of Aleya. A wall of flame erupts within the gateway she's charging for. He also inspires her by shouting ahead, "FUCK EM UP"
One of the hobgoblins shoots at Alpha, but it misses.
Two guards on the walls try to shoot at Aleya. The first one misses, and the second she deflects with Arcane Shield.
The sound of roaring flame alerts those in the minotaur room, and they run out into the courtyard.
Vilgrim is next, so he gets to higher ground. One of the guards on the walls sees a gnome appear and shoots. It misses. Vilgrim tries to shoot back. It misses.
Ganraz sprints up to the gate.
{[b]Round two begins}
Aleya charges through the flames, which Angelo manipulates to make part and flow around Aleya like wings. She then casts Thunderwave on the two guards waiting for her, dealing 20 thunder damage. One of them takes 6 bludgeoning damage by being thrown backwards into the boulder. The manticore takes 10 as the door is thrown open by energy. One of the guards on the wall is also thrown off, killed instantly by the force of the blow.
The minotaur hears the explosion, and charges at Aleya. She uses Arcana Deflection, stopping the charge in its tracks. It swings wildly, dealing 25 DAMAGE. That moment when even the DM cringes.
Gareth tries to jump onto the bugbear's back. He misses, landing just behind him. He then climbs up the bugbear's leg, which it doesn't seem to notice. It is incredibly cold, due to the ice armour it's cast on itself.
Alpha tries to attack the guard in front of the. They deal 17 damage with their assassin blade. He dies. They then move along the walls, shooting at another guard, dealing 9 damage. He doesn't go down.
Brande shoots at one of the armoured guards at the gate, dealing 11 damage.
The manticore fires two spines at Seamus and one at Angelo. Seamus manages to deflect both spines, but Angelo takes 9 damage. The sudden attack catches him off guard, and he loses his concentration. The Major Image drops.
Seamus fires at the manticore, dealing 11 damage.
Angelo runs up behind a boulder near the gate, and he can see that Aleya is injured. He casts Healing Word on her, giving her 10hp back, and then casts Vicious Mockery on the minotaur. "You are one ugly motherfucker." The minotaur has disadvantage on its next attack, but it looks like that next attack might be on Angelo, because he looks pissed off.
Vilgrim gets shot, taking 9 damage. Another guard shoots at Alpha, dealing 4 damage.
Two guards see that the minotaur is clashing with Aleya, and decide to leave it to it. They shout in goblin (which Ganraz understands) "Fall back to Koth".
Vilgrim shoots at the archer he's fighting again. He deals 9 damage.
Ganraz charges the two armoured guards, slamming through them. He's now on the other side of them. He attacks one of them, but it glances off of his shield. He then action surges, and deals 14 damage to the guard. He attacks the second one, but the guard parries.
Gareth hops off of the bugbear.
The bugbear moves to see what's happening in the courtyard. It casts firebolt at Aleya, but it misses.
Aleya sees the huge bugbear, and has to make a wisdom saving throw. She succeeds. She slashes at the minotaur, dealing 4 thunder damage, and 11 force damage. She action surges whilst she still has advantage, and rolls a nat 20.  She slashes again, dealing 17 force damage and 7 fire damage.
The minotaur has disadvantage, so his flails wildly at Aleya but misses.
Alpha puts their hand crossbow away, and pulls out their heavy crossbow. They fire, dealing 21 damage to the manticore. The manticore looks hurt and pissed off. It turns back to look at Alpha. Alpha takes a step backwards.
Brande takes a shot at the archer on the wall, dealing 19 damage. He is definitely dead. His lifeless body topples off the wall. He then puts Hunter's Mark on the guard Ganraz injured.
The manticore lifts off, flying towards Alpha. It slashes at Alpha, dealing 4 points of slashing damage, and then 4 points of piercing damage when it bites at them.
Seamus runs past Aleya, casting Firebolt at the minotaur. It deals 15 damage. The minotaur looks really pissed off. He ducks into a nearby door, which used to be the manticore's room.
Angelo casts Phantasmal Force on the minotaur, conjuring a hellhound as he remembers it. He makes the illusion appear to attack the minotaur, distracting it, and dealing 5 psychic damage. He then Bardic Inspires Seamus.
One of the armoured guards slashes at Ganraz, but misses. The second takes the chance to deal damage, 11 damage.
The hobgoblin on the wall jumps down.
Vilgrim shoots at the archer again, but he misses.
Ganraz does some fucking fancy footwork, ready to deal with these hobgoblins. He preps his dodge action.
Aleya slashes at the minotaur, dealing 8 force and 6 fire damage to the minotaur and 8 to the guard.
The minotaur slashes at Aleya, but she uses Shield so it doesn't do any damage.
Alpha attacks the manticore, dealing 21 points of damage. It looks pretty hurt. They then drop their heavy crossbow, lifting their hand crossbow, and shooting it in the face, dealing 9 damage. The manticore goes down.
Brande shouts to Ganraz, "Are you ok to get a bit hot?" Over his shield, Ganraz shouts back, yelling, "Yes!" Brande steps up, casting Burning Hands and dealing 16 damage to two of the armoured hobgoblins attacking Ganraz. Ganraz also takes 16 damage. He deals 8 to the other armoured hobgoblin.
Seamus drops the Enlarge spell, so Aleya shrinks. He then moves to flank the minotaur, slashing with his glowing axe and dealing 6 damage. The minotaur shudders, his armour shattering, and drops to the ground.
Angelo runs into the courtyard, and sees that Ganraz is looking really hurt. He heals him, giving him 7 hp back. He then spots the archer duelling with Vilgrim, and glares at the archer. "Pathetic." He deals 8 damage, killing the archer instantly.
A hobgoblin tries to attack Seamus.
Vilgrim ducks to be stealthy, and shoots at the bugbear. He deals 17 damage. It shatters the cold armour.
Ganraz tells Brande to deal with the last hobgoblin at the gate, moving to attack the bugbear. He uses his Distracting Strike, dealing 6 damage. He then uses Commander's Strike, commanding Brande to shoot at the bugbear. He deals 11 piercing damage.
The bugbear smiles, and then turns into mist. It floats upwards, and is now 90ft up, floating in the air.
Aleya cuts through the last hobgoblin, and makes her way towards the bugbear.
Alpha picks up their heavy crossbow, and fires at the bugbear. Both shots miss.
Brande runs past the hobgoblin, and rolls a 20. He deals 24 damage, and that definitely kills him. He then moves his Hunter's Mark to the bugbear.
Angelo realises that he can't actually hit the bugbear now. So instead, he focuses on the party. He doesn't know Alpha, and doesn't think he can heal a machine, so he gives 9hp back to Ganraz.
Vilgrim shoots at the bugbear, dealing 5 damage because without commander's strike or sneak attack, Vilgrim is not as competent.
Ganraz uses Commander's Strike to get Brande to shoot. Brande deals 6 damage.
The bugbear snarls at us, "You will rue the day that you messed with the Wyrmlord. For your trouble…" He casts fireball on the whole area. Everyone who succeeds takes 15 damage, everyone else takes 29. Ganraz and Alpha drop unconscious.

{[h]We survived that, somehow}
Aleya stabilises Ganraz. Brande stabilises Alpha with Cure Wounds, 6 hp back.
At this point, Gareth appears. We all slowly turn to look at him.
Brande: Where the fuck have you been?
Gareth: I found this!
He holds up a map that he's found. Brande fills Gareth in one what he missed. Seamus takes the minotaur's axe from Aleya. Aleya and Ganraz investigate the map that Gareth found. Angelo joins them. There's a lot of important shit in it, which concerns us greatly.
Alpha goes in to investigate the bugbear's quarters. They find a narrow shaft that goes down, with a ladder. They light a torch and drop it. It falls for about 40ft. They find a room with lots of tiny metal chests, and a skeleton. The skeleton has a bastard sword, which Alpha carefully tries to move. The skeleton doesn't react. Alpha makes their way over to the desk, and rifles through it. They find a diary, which is written in common. It's the diary of Amery Vrath, and described his quest against the giants. The final entry discusses his victory.
Angelo was on 2hp, so he casts Healing Word on himself and gives himself 7hp back.
Brande decides to go and look for Alpha, who's been missing for about 5 – 10 minutes. Angelo, Aleya and Ganraz are still deep in thought, discussing the map. Vilgrim and Seamus follow Brande.
Brande goes down the ladder, and sees Alpha trying to unlock a door. He asks Alpha what they're looking for. He asks what they're doing, and they say "Carrying out my orders." When asked what these are, they tell him "To recover the deed." When they have it, they'll return to House Cannith.
Through detect magic, Brande can tell there's a lot of magical items in the box he's looking at. Alpha immediately drops the box they were trying to get into. Enchantment, abjuration, restoration, abjuration again. They discover what looks like a dragon skull, some gauntlets, a giant gauntlet, a staff of white wood (which has what looks like an orchid carved into it).
Aleya, Ganraz and Angelo try to work out what "day" the hobgoblins might be on, as their plan apparently is to attack Drellin's Ferry on Day 5.
Alpha thanks the others for helping, because they have achieved what they wanted to, and makes to leave. Vilgrim, a 3 foot gnome, stops them from leaving, saying "Not so fast, warforged." Seamus also wants to talk. He asks who made Alpha, and how old they are. They're about 7, and have of course been sent by House Cannith. Seamus tells them "Mr Tarsch sends his regards." Alpha leaves.
Aleya, Ganraz and Angelo see Alpha appear again, and they wave as they leave. We watch them go, confused. Vilgrim has a quick rifle through the rest of the coffers, and discovers 2500 silver, 2100 gold, 120 platinum.
And here the session ends. `

[Scribe Note #2 The DM told us an hour before the session started that we're all level 6 now. Everyone had to pull a Luke move and quickly change their character sheets last minute]

{[h]Recap and planning}
We're still in Vrath Keep.
Aleya, Angelo and Ganraz are outside, as is Gareth, and Seamus, Brande and Vilgrim are still downstairs. Ganraz asks Gareth where he found the map. He shows him to the desk where there's a lot of notes, and he can't read a lot of it (it's in infernal, which only Brande speaks). He calls Aleya over to cast comprehend languages and see if she can make anything of it.
Everyone helps Brande, who's currently trying to push a gigantic gauntlet up through a trap door.
Aleya is outside, trying to get the notes to behave, but it seems to be in code even with comprehend languages. She tells Ganraz this. She says that perhaps Angelo or Seamus might be better for it "as they're not entirely stupid". She does try to decode it herself, but even with a 23 intelligence check, she hasn't quite got it yet. It would probably take her a day or so to fully decode it.
She asks if we're staying the night here. Brande says that he still has his hunter's mark on Koth, and he's heading north. We debate whether to stay here and rest or to try and go on. We're all looking pretty damaged, and it is night, so those without darkvision will be hindered.
Jorr enters the keep, surprised by the fact that we actually survived that. He tells us that he spotted the warg riders doubling back, and he thought about distracting them. But the warg riders stopped, and he said it looked like one of the riders heard something, and then they headed north.
Ganraz asks if there's another way through skull gorge other than the bridge. Jorr says it's possible, but it would take a long time, and would probably include the making of rafts and climbing rocks. It would definitely be dangerous if someone tried to cross without the bridge. He asks if Jorr will guide us to skull gorge.
Brande grabs a handful of the gold we just looted and gives it to Jorr. The rest of the party look on in horror. Jorr slowly counts out the gold, and it turns out to be 30 gold.
Ganraz gathers the group for a strategy huddle. He points out that destroying the bridge will probably be our best bet, as he believes that we've stumbled upon something much bigger than what we initially thought.
Gareth volunteers to go back to Drellin's Ferry to warn the people there of what we've discovered. Seamus and Angelo think this is a very good idea. Seamus also says that he can make a copy of the map and send a message to Markos. Ganraz says that it may be best for at least the refugee camp to skip town. Angelo agrees, saying that particularly Lady Elise needs to get out.
Seamus grabs some paper and infuses it with a message for Markos. "Hobgoblin invasion imminent. Head to Brindal. Women and children first. Going to Skull Gorge. Stay safe." He hands a copy of the map to Gareth to take with him. He transforms into a bearded wolf, and runs off through the gates.
Angelo asks Ganraz if he definitely intends to camp here for the night. When this confirmed, Angelo grabs a small stone, and goes to cast Leomund's Tiny Hut. Brande asks him what the hell that is (he can't see Angelo now). Angelo tells him to shoot an arrow at the dome, and it shatters on impact. He then allows Brande to enter. He finds the inside is comfortable room temperature, and is dimly lit. Angelo then allows the rest to enter, but internally does not allow Vilgrim, just for a bit of fun. The rest of the party enter, but Vilgrim bounces off of the dome.
Angelo: Oh, I'm terribly sorry Vilgrim, I have no idea how that happened.
Aleya and Brande take the first watch. Aleya tries to decipher more of the code, but she's tired now. Brande completes his watch, and sets up a small campfire. He asks the flames, "Was the bugbear the betrayer?" He gets no response, so he quickly puts the fire out again.
Ganraz takes the second watch, and he would take it with Seamus but we've lost Seamus, we don't know where he's gone. The watch is uneventful, but he feels uneasy. What he's learned has unsettled him, but he trusts Gareth to deliver the message.
Angelo wakes up for the last watch, as does Vilgrim and Seamus. Vilgrim and Seamus go up to the walls to talk. [Scribe note: The following is meta knowledge that no-one but Vilgrim and Seamus can use] Seamus thinks the warforged should never have been made. He says that it also came as great personal cost to him as well. He tells him that he used to be House Cannith, which surprises Vilgrim. He just about manages to keep it together. Vilgrim presses a little, asking why he "was" part of House Cannith, but doesn't pry too much. When asked why he was annoyed by the warforged, Vilgrim tells him that he'd encountered warforged before and could have been living a very different life if not for them.

{[h]In the morning}
[Zol 10 Eyre]
It rained during the night, but that hasn't affected the party because of The Dome. Brande comments that this is better than just camping in a bedroll. Aleya goes a little way away from the party to try to decipher more things.
When she stops making progress, she asks Brande for the items he found in the vault. She ritual casts Identify, and discovers that the gauntlets are Gauntlets of Ogre Power. The staff is The Staff of Orchids. Ten petals remain, so the staff has ten charges, and can cast either Cure Wounds, Lesser Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds, Revivify. The staff can only be recharged by returning it to the grove where the wood that it came from.
Aleya takes the staff to Angelo.
Aleya: This looks like it might suit you. You're good with healing. Do you want it?
Angelo: Are you giving me a gift?
Aleya: No. Do you want it or not?
Angelo: I'll take it, I'm just surprised that you'd trust me with it.
Aleya: I don't trust you with it.
Angelo: You're breaking my heart here, Aleya.
He accepts the staff, and she goes off to check the other items. The whole identifying process takes about 40 minutes. She checks the sword, and discovers it's Vrath's Frost. It does require attuning. It gives the wielder resistance to fire damage. The big boi gauntlet is made of bone, and gives +1 AC.
[Scribe Note: We take a quick break for drinks and figuring out how to divvy up the money we found]
Ganraz gives Vilgrim his short sword. We end up with 416 silver each, 345 gold each, and 20 platinum each.
Jorr has finished his own breakfast. He says he's ready when we are. Seamus asks him what he's eating. Jorr says he thinks it's a rabbit? He's not sure.

{[h]On the road again}
From Vraath's Keep, we think it'll take us about 10 or 11 hours to get to the bridge at Skull Gorge.
Jorr takes the lead, with Brande assisting him. As we get back to the main road, Jorr shows us a faster way to cross the creek safely, and once we have we see that the path has become more of a dirt track after the heavy rainfall. He can see tracks for the wargs. Brande watches his tracking skills closely, trying to learn from him. Looks like the wargs stopped for a bit to rest.
Brande and Seamus have a look around. Brande focuses on the warg tracks, but Seamus goes a little off the path, and spots a set of footprints that seem to lead from the wood to the road. They are humanoid footprints. He thinks someone may have met the wargs here, and calls Jorr to inspect them. Aleya and Brande speculate that it could be the bugbear, because maybe his potion wore off.
She gives Brande a blanket, as he isn't used to the cold. Aww, maybe she doesn't completely hate the genasi boi. She just finds him dumb. Adorable.
She messages Ganraz, worried about spies in the towns who might work for the hobgoblins. Ganraz agrees it's a problem, and she points out that Angelo and Vilgrim are both carrying magical items that we haven't talked about. She thinks we're suspicious, and it's implied she thinks we could potentially be spies for hobgoblins, but Ganraz says that it's unlikely we work for hobgoblins of all things, even if we are suspicious. She suggests that he keep an eye on the two when she's not doing so.
{[h]At the bridge}
For the last two hours, we debate how best to destroy the damn thing. It's made of stone, and we turn to Seamus for ideas. He suggests that we could use magic to enlarge someone and do damage, or we could use thunder damage, or maybe use something corrosive to weaken the pillars holding it up.
The fall is about 150ft. Yikes Scoob.
We roll stealth checks, and most people do ok or really well. Aleya trips every now and again, but no big deal.
The gorge drops to a fast, rushing stream far below. The bridge is old, but seems sturdy, and it's clearly the only easy way to cross.
Those of us who rolled higher than ten on perception can see that there is some sort of camp on the other side of the bridge. Those who rolled higher than 15 can tell there seems to be humanoids on the watchtowers, and on our end of the bridge there's a huge hound with glowing red eyes, flanked by two hobgoblins. A red hand is emblazed on the creature's shields. On the northwest watchtower, there is a slight gleam of green, and curled around the top of the pentagonal roof is a sleek, scaled creature. A large green dragon is perched there. It's enjoying the sun, but its eyes are fixed on the bridge.
Well, shit.
We're not liking our chances so much. Even Aleya asks Ganraz if he's sure about this. Angelo says he doesn't like our chances if that thing on the watchtower is what he thinks it is. Brande asks him what he thinks it is, and Angelo explains it as a lizard that can fly and breathe clouds of poison. The dragons ended the age of demons, and then retreated to elsewhere. Angelo relays this very basically to Brande, skipping the lore lesson, and letting him know it's big and dangerous.
Ganraz, with his knowledge of goblinoid, has been bothered by something for a while. Goblins seem to stick to shorter names, and the name from the map was very different to what he's used to. The dragon makes a bit more sense now.
As the sun is setting, we do a quick check to see who can see in the dark. Only Aleya can't. Brande says he wasn't aware that people couldn't see in the dark. Seamus asks him if there's anything he is aware of. Damn, even Seamus is getting in on the Brande-bashing. Even his fire resistance can't save him from a roasting.
Vilgrim asks Ganraz how he intends to retreat. Ganraz admits that if we can't blow up the bridge, he doesn't think we'd be able to. We would be bombarded by wave after wave of reinforcement.
When asked, the DM tells us that if we managed to shatter one part of the bridge, then the rest would definitely go down. Getting to it is still incredibly risky.
We debate sending Brande and Seamus, with Angelo's invisibility, but Angelo warns that once they start attacking things, his spell might break, and then he can't recast it because they're too far away from him. We also can't provide much cover because we're too far away.
Out of character, we discuss the various options. The hellhound provides another problem, as Ganraz and Angelo believe that it will be able to smell the invisible people.
Angelo has been keeping an eye on the bridge, because he was waiting to be told what to do. He notices that the hobgoblin that was patrolling the bridge has gone into one of the tents.
Whilst people are debating, Angelo hears a voice in his head. [Scribe Note: I fully thought this was going to be the bugbear or the dragon talking, my heart skipped a beat. Bruh, too tense] It's Itaan, and he says that Gareth has arrived, and has warned the caravan.
Angelo replies: We will try, but there is a dragon here. Get Elise to safety, and tell Markos to move the caravan quickly. We'll destroy the bridge.
Ganraz reminds everyone that it will be very dangerous once we start our distraction, and we'll send Brande and Seamus to destroy the bridge (Angelo will turn them invisible).

{[h]This is risky as shit}
Brande and Seamus creep through the long grass. It brushes gently against them. Despite knowing they're invisible, it is disturbing being exposed like this. As they break the treeline, there is a wind that they didn't notice previously because we were sheltered by the trees. It muffles their footsteps a little.
They make it to the edge of the gorge. The DM rolls two natural twenties, which is a fucking joke, and Brande's foot make a slight scuff. One of the guards turned towards the sound, but didn't see anything, and turned back again. Yeah, you better not discover our sneaky bois.
Aleya messages Seamus, asking if he's in position. Seamus tells him no. The rest of the party continue to wait.
Seamus manages to make it to his place, and casts spider climb on himself. He then places his foot onto the wall, and walks under the bridge. He rolls a 12 on his stealth check. There doesn't seem to be any sound from the guards.
After waiting another 5 minutes or so, Aleya casts message again, asking if Seamus is in position. He says he is, so the rest of us get ready to move.
Vilgrim asks Ganraz if he can have the first attack. He sneaks up, and notches and arrow, aiming at the hellhound. He deals 32 damage. The hellhound was just sitting by the bridge, and an arrow shoots through its head. It looks pretty hurt, but doesn't go down.
And that's where we leave this session. The next session will begin with The Battle of Skull Gorge. `

`{[h]Roll for initiative}
Retroactive planning – we figure out exactly who is moving where, and Aleya messages Ganraz telling him that if he sees the opportunity to retreat then he should take it as the pseudo leader of the group. He tells her it won't come to that, and that if it turns bad then we will all retreat together.
The distraction team (Ganraz, Aleya, Angelo and Vilgrim) sprint for the long grass. Brande and Seamus are in position.
Initiative order: Vilgrim, Seamus, Brande, Angelo, Ganraz, Aleya
Jorr fires at one of the hobgoblins in the right-hand tower. It looks pretty hurt, but is still up.
Vilgrim takes another shot at the hellhound, dealing 10 damage. It looks REALLY hurt, and frustrated that it's not got any immediate targets. He then runs to the base of the right tower, and bonus action hides.
Seamus hears the hellhound roar in anger, and knows that it's time to go. He slams his axe into the bridge, dealing 11 damage. It has begun to weaken, cracks scattering across the stonework. He does it again, dealing 12 damage, and then another 12. He then casts his arm barrier, gaining 30 temporary hit points and +2 AC. He then sprints up the side of the tower to get out of Brande's way.
Brande sees Seamus become visible, using his shatter spell on the bridge. He deals 12 points of damage. There's a spray of dust and a thunderous boom, and Seamus can see cracks spiderwebbing across the bridge. Brande's second shatter does 26 damage. A spectral arrows pierces the bridge, and then a shockwave almost bows the bridge. There are larger breaks spreading. It's spread about halfway across the bridge.
Angelo tries to cast Vicious Mockery on the hellhound, but it gets exactly 15 and saves. He then turns to Ganraz and says "Don't die", casting bardic inspiration on him.
Ganraz charges across the grass, slashing at the hobgoblin, dealing 15 damage, killing it. He then uses his other attack on the hellhound, using one of his manoeuvring strikes dealing 10 damage, killing that too. He then lunges for the other hobgoblin on the ground, using his shield master ability to shove him backwards, knocking him prone.
The orange hobgoblin on the right tower moves to the edge. It fires a flaming arrow into the air. The red hobgoblin turns and fires down at Ganraz. He deals 3 piercing damage. The green hobgoblin on the left tower shoots at Vilgrim, dealing 9 damage. The blue hobgoblin takes a shot at Aleya, but misses. The hobgoblin on the ground tries to swing at Ganraz, but he's concussed and misses entirely.
Only Ganraz can understand the shouting from across the bridge, as more hobgoblins start running towards our side of the bridge.
Aleya charges forwards, firing Magic Missile at the green archer and the red archer. She deals 10 to both.
The green dragon lazily unfurls its wings and then flies towards us. Makes it to our side of the bridge effortlessly, and it's about 60ft above us.
Jorr fires again, but his arrow pings off the dragon's armour.
Vilgrim runs up the stairs of the right tower. He takes a shot at the orange archer. He's tired, and it misses.
Seamus runs out underneath the bridge. He attacks twice, dealing 6 damage, and then 7. He then moves to the edge of the bridge, but doesn't come up from under. Another few cracks skitter across the bridge. It still hasn't broken. Fuuuuck.
Brande shoots at the bridge, dealing 19 points of piercing damage. The crack deepens, and Seamus can tell from his position that the bridge has taken a lot of structural damage.
Angelo runs forwards, dealing 6 damage to the green archer. It wounds not only his pride but his body. It dies. He then looks at Aleya, and says "You're not allowed to die either." Bardic inspiration.
Ganraz takes the dodge action.
Two more hobgoblins move to attack Ganraz, but all three of them miss. The blue archer tries to avenge his green boyfriend, and shoots at Angelo. He hits, but due to Angelo's cutting words he only takes 1 damage. He tries to shoot at Vilgrim but misses. The archer across the river shoots at Brande but misses. The hobgoblins on the bridge run towards us.
Angelo, Aleya and Ganraz have to roll perception checks. Ganraz can see a figure moving across the other side of the bridge, coming out of the tent and moving towards the tower.
Aleya runs up to where Ganraz is, carving through the red hobgoblin with green flame blade and dealing 23 damage. She deals 9 fire damage to the green hobgoblin beside him.
The dragon descends until it's about 10 foot up, and sneers at us in common this time. "You must be the runts Koth was telling me about. So small." It then breathes a cloud of poison onto Aleya and Ganraz, who both have to roll con saves. Ganraz takes 43 poison damage. Aleya takes 12.
BIG Y I K E
Jorr shoots at the blue archer, dealing 11 points of damage and killing him.
Vilgrim charges the orange archer, wielding his new shortsword. He deals 10 damage.
Seamus hits the bridge again, dealing 7 and then 6 damage. He then stays low, but off of the bridge. Large crack emerge along the surface. It looks very heavily damaged.
The dragon looks down and sees the cracks begin to emerge along the top of the bridge. It has apparently taken note of the damage.
Brande moves up. He shoots at the bridge, dealing 17 piercing and 1 force damage. The bridge looks very damaged.
Angelo runs forwards a bit, casting Vicious Mockery on the hellhound he can see. It deals 6 psychic damage and has disadvantage. He then casts Healing Word on Ganraz, giving him 10 hp back.
Ganraz sets up his dodge and uses Second Wind to give himself 9hp back.
The orange archer tries to hit Vilgrim but misses. The green hobgoblin tries to attack Ganraz but misses. He then attacks Aleya, dealing 16 damage. Another arrows comes across the bridge at Brande, but misses. The hobgoblin captain dashes towards us, and comes into the range of Aleya's detect magic. She can tell he has restoration magic on him.
We all have to roll another perception check. Everyone above 10 can see a vague silhouette on the other side of the bridge. Everyone above 15 recognises it as Koth, that bugbear fuck. From this distance we can't see his exact expression but he probably looks pissed.
The hellhound breathes fire at Ganraz, Aleya and the green hobgoblin. The green hobgoblin is incinerated. 20 damage, and Aleya goes down. Ganraz takes no damage.
The dragon sees Aleya go down, and flies towards the tower. It sees Seamus and attacks. It deals 2 points of poison damage to him.
Jorr hurries across the field, putting his hunter's mark on the pink hobgoblin. An arrow whistles past Angelo's shoulder and embeds in the shield. His two dogs, Leila and Bill, charge at the pink hobgoblin.
Vilgrim takes another slash at the orange archer. He deals 11 damage, killing him. He then moves to the other side of the tower, bonus action hiding so he can get that stealth kill next time.
Seamus sees this dragon, and doesn't give a fuck about it. He ignores it, firing a bolt of flame at the bridge and dealing 18 damage. Chunks of masonry are flying, and this bridge looks pretty fucked. One more solid hit will probably do it.
The dragon looks panicked at the sight of the damage the bridge has taken. Seamus stares it down. Flex on that fucking dragon.
Brande can see a latticework of cracks across the bridge.
Angelo: He can do it
Aleya, on fire, in the midst of her death throes: He's not gonna do it
Brande uses his sharpshooter again, dealing 21 magical piercing damage to the bridge. The entire bridge shakes under the impact, and part of the bridge actually crumbles away. It looks like it's barely holding its structural integrity. As his bonus action he hexes the dragon, giving it disadvantage on wisdom checks. Its perception is now at a disadvantage.
Angelo darts to his left, casting Healing Word on Aleya and giving her 12hp back. She lives! He then casts Vicious Mockery on the pink hobgoblin, telling him there's a special place in hell for people who kill animals, dealing 5 damage.
Ganraz slashes at the hellhound, dealing 5 slashing damage and 6 frost. He then swings at the orange hobgoblin, but he deflects. Ganraz then shoves the hobgoblin captain backwards and putting him on the ground.
Fucking Useless Arrow Boi across the river shoots at Brande and misses yet again. Pink hobgoblin completely misses Leila. The purple hobgoblin tries to attack Angelo, but the bard boi dodges it. The orange hobgoblin tries to attack Ganraz but misses. The hobgoblin captain tries to make two greatsword attacks on Ganraz, dealing 22 damage.
Koth uses Misty Step to get all the way to the middle of the bridge. Get fucked boi, Seamus just needs one hit.
The hellhound tries to make a bite attack against Aleya. She manages to hold it off, even though she's still on the ground.
Aleya gets up, shoving this hellhound off of her. She picks up her sword, and attacks the hobgoblin with green flame blade. She deals 14 force damage, 8 fire damage. The orange hobgoblin takes 11 fire damage. The orange hobgoblin is definitely dead. The hobgoblin stays up. She regains 13hp with her second wind.
The dragon, seeing Koth arrive, snarls at Seamus and flies around to the other side of the tower. It spots Brande, smiles at him, and says "Hello there." It deals 52 damage with its breath weapon. Brande is down.
Jorr fires at the pink hobgoblin, dealing 16 damage, dropping him. Leila and Bill tear into him, killing him.
Vilgrim can now see Koth. He assumes Aleya, Ganraz and Angelo can take the hellhound and the hobgoblin captain. He shoots at Koth, dealing 20 damage. A large chunk of ice shatters away from Koth, but the ice armour he's cast on himself remains.
Seamus can't see what the dragon has done. He shoots a bolt of flame at the bridge, dealing 5 damage. The flame impacts with the stone, and a deep latticework of cracks appears on the bridge. The bridge rumbles, lists, and then crumbles down into the ravine below. Seamus spiderclimbs up to the top of the tower. THE BRIDGE IS GOING DOWN!
Brande has to roll a death saving throw. He saves.
Angelo pirouettes around the purple hobgoblin trying to kill him, and rolls a natural 20. Holy shit. He deals 16 damage to the hobgoblin, stabbing it through the throat and killing it. Then, seeing the bridge falling, he yells to Ganraz "We should probably start getting out of here." Bardic inspiration.
Ganraz misses his first attack, but deals 15 damage on his second. He then moves to flank the hellhound. Then he looks at Koth, seeing the bridge going down, and shouts "Hey Koth! What goes up must come down!"
The hobgoblin captain tries to attack Aleya but misses.
Koth, after that Vicious Mockery from Ganraz, sprints for the edge of the bridge. He's still alive. Fuck sake.
The hellhound tries to attack Aleya, but it misses.
Aleya asks Ganraz if he's ready, and then casts second level thunderwave. Koth uses Counterspell. "You're not going to get away that easily." She action surges and does it again. Her thunderwave deals 20 damage to the hellhound, and 10 to the captain and Koth. The captain dies. The hellhound is thrown towards Leila and Bill. Ganraz takes 10 damage, but she warned him so she ain't getting punched.
The dragon looks very pissed that the bridge has been destroyed. Koth looks back at the dragon. The dragon swoops down and tries to make three attacks on Ganraz. The first two attacks hit, dealing first 7 damage, the second dealing 14 damage. Ganraz is down.
Jorr is up next. He takes a shot at the hellhound, and rolls a nat 20. It's killed instantly. He then calls his dogs back to him. Jorr is the motherfucking MVP.
Vilgrim aims at Koth, but shouts out. "You've lost your position. Your forces are weakened. What do you gain from trying to kill the rest of us?" It does not work. So he shoots at Koth. It deals 22 damage. Koth definitely knows he's there.
Seamus still has spiderclimb up, so he manages to drop down the tower safely. He takes some fall damage, because he rolled a 1 and did not stick the landing. He takes 9 damage. He's prone, and casts Spare the Dying on Ganraz to stabilise him. He then activates his axe, summoning forth lightning magic.
Brande rolls another death saving throw. He succeeds. Two saves.
Angelo sees Koth is still alive, and shouts at him. "Why the fuck are you still alive?" It deals 7 psychic damage. Koth looks very pissed off. He then gives Ganraz 11hp back.
Ganraz wakes up and sees Seamus next to him and a dragon above him. He temporarily finds it very hard to lift his shield due to his injury. Knowing that he's not able to lift it he drops it and pushes himself to his feet. Ganraz moves around the dragon and shoves Koth. He staggers backwards 5ft. He then shoves again, and Koth staggers backwards another 5ft. Koth is right on the edge, teetering, but just about manages to regain his balance. Not for long though, because Ganraz shoves him for a final time, and Koth falls. He takes 9d6 of bludgeoning damage, which totals as 38. He just about manages to catch a ledge.
It's Koth's turn. He gets to his feet, as he's on a tiny ledge. He tries to climb up the sheer rocks, and manages to do so, slowly making his way up. He's about 25ft down the gorge.
Aleya sees that Ganraz pretty much has Koth sorted, so she focuses on the dragon. She uses her booming blade, dealing 13 force and 7 thunder. It looks pissed off.
The dragon's turn. It still doesn't have its breath weapon back. It calls Koth a failure. It then tries to attack Seamus and Aleya, but misses. He takes 15 thunder damage because it tries to fly up and get out of range. Aleya gets an attack of opportunity, and deals a further 22 force damage, and 14 thunder damage. He takes another 10 thunder damage because he's still moving.
Jorr takes a shot at the dragon, but it misses.
Vilgrim is up. He doesn't like his chances of shooting an arrow at a dragon. He instead moves towards the edge of the tower, and makes a risky drop. He rolls 19 on his acrobatics, so he just about manages to stick the landing. He does take 6 bludgeoning damage, but he's ok. He then moves back, getting ready to run.
Seamus gets up, and begins to retreat too as he sees Vilgrim fleeing. He uses his dash to get further away from the dragon, who is now 80ft above us.
Brande rolls another death saving throw, and fails. Two saves one fail.
Angelo sees that Aleya and Ganraz look pretty hurt. He knows he can't hit the dragon, so he casts healing word on Ganraz, giving him 8hp back, and then shouts to Aleya and Ganraz that they should start retreating. He then pulls back a little, but chooses to keep Aleya and Ganraz within his range of healing.
Ganraz burns one of his actions to give Vilgrim the chance to hit. Unfortunately it glances off of the dragon's scales. He then turns to look at Aleya, and tells her "We can do this."
Koth is next. He uses his final Misty Step to get up to the top of the cliff, and tells the dragon that they both may need to retreat. He then takes two attacks on Ganraz. He rolls a nat 20 and deals 33 bludgeoning damage. It fails two of Ganraz's death saves.
Aleya just watched Ganraz get absolutely hammered by this bugbear. She succeeds on her wisdom saving throw. Even though she's shaking, the sword keeps her composure. She casts Magic Missile against the dragon. It deals 15 force damage. She moves towards Ganraz, and the dragon has to flap its wings hard to stay airborne.
The dragon is thoroughly unimpressed by everything Koth has just done. He snarls at Koth, "No. You have failed Azarr Kul too many times." Koth seems pissed at the dragon leaving him behind. He looks a bit unhinged.
Jorr shoots at Koth and then begins backing away. It's a natural 20. It deals 14 piercing damage. Jorr and his hounds run back towards the treeline.
Vilgrim is running, and looks back over his shoulder to see whether everyone's following him. When he sees the battlefield has drastically changed, and shoots at Koth. Koth uses his shield.
Seamus decides he's gonna get in on that, and uses Firebolt to deal 15 damage to Koth. He's really really hurt, and he looks fucking furious.
Brande has to make another save. It's his third success. He's stabilised.
Angelo sees that Ganraz has gone down, and uses Healing Word on him. He gives 8hp back. Then he yells at Koth, "Just stay down!" Koth takes 7 damage and looks pissed off.
Ganraz gets to his feet, and rolls a nat 20 on one of his attacks. He uses his distracting strike, and it's going to be pretty fucking distracting. 27 slashing damage, 2 frost damage. He drives his sword through Koth's chest, and watches the bugbear stagger back, surprised, and he keeps laughing. He spits a big glob of blood on the floor. "Don't you see? You are already dead. He's coming for all of you." He then slumps to the floor, definitely dead.
And that is where we will end the session. `

{[h]Wrapping up at the bridge}
[It's 11 Eyre – it's currently 3am, the day after we left Vraath's Keep. We're basically in a John Wick film right now, where everything happens within one week]
Angelo found three dragon scales on the ground. They're about 4 inches in diameter. As he does so, he looks over his shoulder and asks, "Where is Brande?"
Seamus is also looking to regroup, so he jogs round to see if he can find our good genasi boi. He discovers Brande unconscious, and after checking around to make sure everything's safe, and he casts Cure Wounds, giving him 9hp back. Brande comes to, and his lungs are burning. Both he and Ganraz will probably have a bit of a cough for a while, despite the magical healing.
Seamus fills him in quickly, lifting him from the ground like he weighs nothing. Vilgrim spots them coming, and is surprised by Brande's condition. He offers him some sipp.
Meanwhile, Aleya sheaths her blade and slumps back against the wall of the tower. Ganraz still hasn't fully healed, despite the magical healing, so he straps it up and cracks on with his search of the corpse. Ganraz looks at Koth, Angelo looks at the guard captain, Seamus goes up the tower to look around. Vilgrim pokes around the hellhound and the hobgoblin bodies nearby.
Vilgrim finds nothing on the hellhound, and the hobgoblins carry no coins. They each have the shields with the red hand painted on them. A longsword, not elegant but well-made. Armour is standard chain shirts. There's a few more Tiamat pendants.
Seamus finds similar stuff in the tower, but there's more archers up there. He finds a lot of arrows, sconces on the walls, and two arrows coated with fabric dipped in oil. He grabs the two signalling arrows.
Angelo searches the guard captain. He's got finer armour and a buckler so he can wield his sword two-handed. It looks very well made and has some sort of inscription on it. Angelo thinks they don't look magical. 50 gold pieces, 110 platinum. A potion of some description.
Ganraz looks at Koth. He seems to be wearing a reinforced leather armour, and shards of it have broken off where Ganraz' blade went through. He has a very heavy Morningstar. Two potions, small vials of a silvery liquid that flows slowly. 200 gold, 500 silver in the smaller pouches. His boots look very well made too. Leather pouch tied to his belt, but Ganraz can't see anything within it. He reaches in slowly, and grabs something that seems kind of smooth, and he pulls it out. It appears to be a humanoid skull. Ganraz knows that bugbears as a race do take heads as a symbol of victory, usually the ones who belonged to those deemed worthy opponents. He reaches in again, pulling out a scroll, another potion, a wand made of silvered metal that wraps around and holds blue crystals, 543 gold. 2400 silver. He puts all of his spare gubbins into the Bag of Holding so that he's not encumbered.
Whilst everyone is looting bodies, Brande moves to the edge of the bridge to see if he can see anyone on the other side. He gets 11 on his perception check, so he can't see anything over the other side. He can't see the dragon coming back though, so he's pleased.
Aleya waits until Ganraz and Angelo have moved all the important items away, and then goes up to Koth's body. She draws her sword, going ham on him and then tosses the pieces into the ravine. Yikes.
Ganraz has moved over to where Jorr is, sitting in the long grass by the treeline. He reaches into his new Bag of Holding and gives Jorr 200 gold in a small pouch. Jorr is pleased by the amount, though he doesn't show much outwardly. A man of action rather than words. We don't deserve Saint Jorr. Ganraz commends him on being incredibly heroic, and Jorr says that the dragon seemed pretty serious.
Angelo cautiously approaches the pile of items, and looks over at Aleya. He asks her if she feels a bit better. She says not really, and then asks if he healed her earlier. When he says he did, she awkwardly thanks him. He awkwardly accepts her gratitude, shrugging it off as no big deal. They both gather up the items, and move back towards the treeline.
Aleya asks Brande how he's doing. He admits that that was one of the most terrifying experiences of his life.
We all gain a point of exhaustion because it's currently 3am.

{[h]Out of danger (for now)}
We travel for about an hour, and then make it to a clearing. Angelo casts Leomund's Tiny Hut, so we set up camp. Ganraz sleeps. Brande also passes out. Aleya casts Identify on the wand before she goes to sleep, and discovers it's a Wand of Magic Missile, and then goes to sleep as well. Angelo volunteers to take first watch, seeing as he took the least damage. Jorr stays outside.
We all take a long rest.
Aleya casts Identify on the rest of the items. She has two potions, Angelo has a potion, the Wand was identified, and the boots from Koth. Angelo has a potion of Greater Healing (20hp). The two silvery vials are Elixirs of Truth. Ooooh. She gives the potion of Greater Healing to Vilgrim, and gives one of the Elixirs to Ganraz. She tells him what it does over Message. The boots are Boots of the Vigilant. You can sense impending danger when you're wearing them. She gives those to Vilgrim as well. The scroll is a Scroll of Blink. Aleya gives Angelo the Wand of Magic Missile. He's surprised by the second gift, and she says he did save her life. Lads, I think we're finally making friends. She keeps the Scroll of Blink for herself.
Ganraz spent the 50 or so minutes (whilst Aleya and Angelo were checking out the items) checking over his arm, and Brande goes to help.
[DM asks Vilgrim to roll. He gets a 10. DM says "Ok". What does this mean]
Jorr has made a very bland breakfast.
With our fairly high passive perceptions, we can hear horse hooves approaching. Even though we think we're mostly out danger, Ganraz still readies his weapons, and the rest of the party follows suit. We see a familiar dwarf, along with a man with accentuated lupine features, and a woman with red hair.
It's our bois, Gareth, Jhen and Robin.
[Gareth had made it back to the town, and a meeting was called when he gave the map and the recording to them. Markos spoke on behalf of the party, saying we wouldn't lie about something as big as a dragon and an army of hobgoblins. Itaan also messaged Angelo and they got his report too. So they were sent to find us]
Gareth, seeing us, approaches and asks how we are. Vilgrim says we're alive. Ganraz tells him that the dragon is alive, but the bridge has been destroyed. Gareth asks what condition the dragon was in, and Angelo says that Aleya sent it off crying.
Robin tells us she was surprised by Markos taking charge as quickly as he did, and was impressed by how Gareth was able to convince people to get moving.
We introduce Jorr to Robin, Jhen and Gareth.
They're astounded by our incredible hunting ability, considering we've left a fair few bodies in our wake. Jhen says he was sent by Markos to scout ahead, but if there's no bridge he's not sure what he's supposed to be scouting. Aleya rolls an insight check on Jhen, and DM sends her what she discovers. Ganraz tells Jhen that he should maybe look for another route across, as we've slowed the army down but not fully stopped them.
[It's still 11 Eyre, just later in the day]
Jhen points out where the army might cross, and then tells Gareth that he looks tired and probably should sit down. Gareth does so, and Jorr pushes a bowl of the sort-of-porridge towards Gareth.
We know that the army consists of multiple tribes, and that we saw about 5 tents on the bridge. Plus a dragon. Brande is worried that if the scouting/advance force has a dragon, then what does the main force have.
Robin asks if we have some notes for her, taken from the keep. Aleya has the four different notes; one is a couple of pages, two are short, and one is medium length. Short to long, it would take 2 for the short and 4 for the long.
Robin is about to ask if Aleya can have a look at it. She doesn't get a chance to, because an arm wraps around her and pulls her backwards. A hooded figure steps out from the tree behind Robin, and pulls back the hood to show a surprisingly handsome face. His smile is a little too wide, to the point of being unnerving. It's almost like he stepped out of the tree itself.

{[h]It's a taller, burlier David Tennant}
He says he's been sent to have a little chat. Says he has many names, one being Adan Edain. Only Ganraz and Aleya recognise the name. Ganraz immediately casts Imprint Prey on him. He prefers the name "Mr Flay" though. Brande asks what the hell he's doing here. He says he's not holding a knife, but he could break Robin. He says the last part in a voice that is spoken without him moving his lips.
He says he was sent by his master (The Other Voice calls it his captor). His face warps, and becomes scaled, and changes to a bright blue. A large horn breaks out of the scales, with two smaller horns set at the back. The features appear to be that of a hobgoblin.
"I am High Wyrmlord Azarr Kul, leader of the 'Kulkor Zhul', son of Tyrgarun and champion of the dragon queen. I have been made aware that you have killed my servant Wyrmlord Koth. This is regrettable. He served me well and was her loyal servent. This is an impressive feat however. One that required some skill. Although my Muut compels me to raze this land, I am not required to kill you. Despite the wishes of this creature before you, I will not yet send my agents after you. You have earned that much.
I give you this one chance. I do not expect you to join me, but continue to defy me and you will burn like the rest."
The face snaps back, and it's David Tennant again. He asks us if we want to send a message back.
Ganraz asks him how he came to be in his service. He doesn't roll well on his persuasion check. David Tennant tells him that it was like any business transaction. He asks how Koth looked when he died. Other Voice says that he wanted to snap Koth. Relatable.
Brande asks why we should let him leave. He says he's got no reason to hurt us. Angelo says if that's the case, he wouldn't mind letting Robin go. David Tennant smiles and says that he was told not to hurt the party, nobody said anything about the others.
He breaks Robin's arm. Everyone moves at once. Jhen and Brande fire at the same time. Brande deals 17 damage, and Jhen hits him in the shoulder the other side. He doesn't seem to really register the pain. [Scribe Note: I won't describe everything he does here]

{[h]We all roll for initiative. Because fuck this guy.}
Initiative order: Aleya, Angelo, Vilgrim, Brande, Gareth, Ganraz, Seamus
Aleya releases Magic Missile. The spell just fails, as if it had been counterspelled. She decides to not cast another spell, and instead decides to hold her turn for the moment Robin is released for whatever reason.
Angelo steps forwards, trying to impose his will and cast Hold Person on him, but then gets the impression that this thing is not a humanoid. He then casts Bardic Inspiration on Aleya, telling her to move quickly.
Mr Flay uses his legendary action, smiling at Angelo and taking a bite out of Robin. He deals 32 damage (lessened by 6 because of Angelo's Cutting Words). She falls unconscious in his arms.
As Robin drops to the ground, Aleya sweeps forwards, slashing at him. 19 force, 6 thunder damage. We hear this tearing sound as the cloak is torn open. Underneath aren't clothes, but instead twisting, eldritch tattoos. He looks surprised and pissed off at that, but then 11 thunder damage.
He's interested by the sword she's carrying, and then disappears into the shadows. He's just gone.

{[h]Well that was fucked}
Angelo and Brande both run over and heal Robin. Brande 14, Angelo 13. The bone is reset, and she comes to. She's having a bit of a panic attack, but Angelo's got her. Brande asks if Jhen can see anything, and goes to help him.
Aleya turns to Ganraz, and asks him if he remembers the things on the mural in the tomb. The eldritch thing that the hobgoblins were fighting.
Angelo soothes Robin, sitting with her and helping her through her panic attack. He gives her another 8hp back, and then casts countercharm to help her further. Everyone who can hear him talking are also calmed somewhat, particularly the ones who were frightened by his legendary action (Brande, Aleya and Ganraz).
Jhen returns to the group and checks in on Robin. We agree to give her a little time to compose herself, giving us half an hour before we set off. It feels a lot lighter now, even though it's obviously early afternoon.
Ganraz says that this thing has aligned itself with our new foes. He explains that that creature is why he's actually here in the Elsir Vale. As part of his work, he chases bounties. This particular bounty was set with no expectation of it being claimed. He had previously believed that Adan Edain was something of a serial killer in Breland. The niece of the king of Breland was killed, as well as a camp of 8 people. Angelo has heard rumours of this too. Aleya expresses her suspicions about it being related to the monsters from centuries ago, from the stories we found in the mural.
Ganraz says he imagines that we will encounter David Tennant again, but for now we should focus on the other leads we have. The Ghost Lord etc.
We gather ourselves and move on to our next camp. Aleya continues trying to decode the messages, with some help from Seamus.
{[b]The first short message says:} Kharn and Abithrax march from cinder hill in two days. Watch for his crimson wings. Prepare your Dar. The beginning of our resurgence is nigh. They will learn to fear the Kulkor Zhul. [Scribe Note: The Tiamat pendant does have five colours]
{[b]The second says:} Wyrmlords,
My progress in the ruined city is good despite the interference of the wolfmen. The broods grow strong under my watch. A few more weeks under and our forces will receive the aid I have been tasked to bring. They grow stronger by the day and we will have enough to rend and tear by the months end. May she guide your hunts.
Wyrmlord Saarvith
{[b]The longest one says:} Wyrmlord Kharn,
I trust the preparations are going well. This month has been productive, and we have learnt much.
Ozyrrendion holds the bridge as commanded. His demeanour is unsettling.
The ruined keep has proven to be useful forward base of operations.  From the keep my scouts have been able to gain a good understanding of the terrain and the river town known as ‘Drellin's Ferry'.
The wood itself should be comfortable enough to traverse. The road is serviceable and should allow for the larger beasts.
Our forays into the less maintained areas of the woods have revealed some creatures worth avoiding but none dangerous enough to engage with our forces.
We did encounter a large outpost to the north west. It appears to mostly be ruins and occupied by a single mad forest giant. He is frail and a thorough scout of the surrounding area found no further threats in that direction.
The town itself has a meagre guard force. Some of this force was sent to investigate why no traders had come from the north. We ensured that none survived. This further reduces the threat posed from the town's conventional defences.
Saarvith's Lurkers discovered one arcane practitioner within the town. This individual keeps to themselves and does not appear to assist the guard details. Regardless, they should be a primary target in the first moments of our attack.
In the recent days a ragtag group around 90 strong entered the town. Reports from my scouts suggest that only 15 of their number are fighters. I await further reports from my Warpriest assigned to this group.
During our attack, the river crossing must be secured quickly should we have the element of surprise. If this is not possible, they will cut the crossing. This should not delay us by much however.
May she watch over your march Wyrmlord.
Koth
{[b]The last one says:} Koth,
I am placing great faith in you by elevating you to the position of Wyrmlord. Continue in your successes and prove my faith justified.
This will be your first charge. I am assigning you 50 seasoned Dar led by Captain Aran along with a contingent of Wargs. Kharn will provide other resources as he sees fit.
Your first task is to take the old dwarf bridge that spans the gorge to the south. Ozyrrendion will accompany you and remain with Captain Aran to hold the bridge.
You will then establish a forward scouting post for our main force. Rast's lurkers have already located a ruin that could serve this purpose.
Learn what you can of the defences of the town that holds the river crossing. Do not give away our intent. No scouts from the town are to return alive.
Do not fail me in this task. Do well and you may lead the attack on the town personally.
High Wyrmlord Azarr Kul

Jhen says he believes he knows the wolfmen. If he's correct, they are the tribe he's originally from, though he hasn't been back in a long time. They operate around the plains to the north. He finds it heartening to know they are still causing trouble.
Aleya and Ganraz make History checks to see if they've heard of the Lurkers before. Aleya rolls a 22, so she knows that they've provided intel before, as they're a mercenary company. She can't recall the name of the leader, but she knows it wasn't Saarvith.
Angelo picked up on "crimson wings" specifically, and pulls out his Tiamat pendant that he'd kept. He knows the major features of each dragon, and knows that red dragons are the most dangerous, and breathe fire. Abithrax is clearly a red dragon, and judging by the pendant he's one of five. He starts putting things together and assumes that there's five Wyrmlords and five dragons to go with them.
Vilgrim knows that the area called the Thornwaste and everything below it is kind of like a desert-esque wasteland. Badlands rather than straight up desert.

We end the session here, slightly traumatised. `

{[h]Recap}
The party has moved to a new location, about a day and a half's ride from Drellin's Ferry. It's about 1pm now, so the sun is high in the sky. It's been about an hour since Mr Flay's entrance.
Robin tells us that the caravan hasn't actually left Drellin's Ferry yet, at least not when their small group left. She says that the plan was to move on to Terrelton.
Aleya asks if we should head back to Drellin's Ferry. Ganraz says it's probably the best plan. She points out that heading to Rhest is most likely where we want to go next, but she also wants a night's rest in a genuine bed. Angelo agrees.
We move towards Drellin's Ferry.

{[h]Travelling}
[It's 12 Eyre today]
The heavy storms have passed, and we're following the well-trodden paths. Brande helps Jorr roll survival checks.
Aleya messages Ganraz, asking him what he wants to do about Adan Edain. Ganraz says we'll have to kill him, but we have more immediate issues for now.
Robin is uncharacteristically quiet, which is not surprising after what just happened. Jhen is characteristically quiet. Jorr is leading the party.
We reach Vraath Keep, set on the hill. The corpses are all still there, and everything seems to be as we left it. It feels like it was just yesterday that we were here.
Brande does a quick look around. He rolls low on investigation, so he thinks everything looks like it did when we left. He goes over to Ganraz and Aleya, and Gareth, and asks them to help him move all the bodies into a pile or something. He is hoping to burn the bodies, to release their tine. They agree to do so, and they move the bodies into the manticore room.
Vilgrim looks around in the stables, looking for a good place to set up beds.
Brande burns the bodies, controlling the flame with his magic. He finds himself getting lost as he stares into the flames. There are a couple of images that briefly appear to him. The first is a silhouette of the bridge we just destroyed, entirely made of flame, crumbling. Then he sees a flash image of a head, reptilian, silhouetted in fire, and then they turn into five heads. Then a flaming red hand appears. He then sees broken buildings, also made entirely out of flame. He doesn't really recognise them.
Aleya rolls an insight check, and can tell that Brande is uneasy, and gets a bit spaced out when he looks into the fire. He also mentioned his fire god, so she makes the connection and doesn't ask anymore.
Angelo finds a quiet corner to flick through his black book, look over the notes he's previously made and writes a few more in.
Gareth climbs up to the roof of the tower, and finds the flayed body that Vilgrim and Gareth discovered when they first came to Vraath's Keep. He pokes it with a stick. Definitely dead. He then inspects the body. He rolls high on his medicine check. Given the build, he can tell it's not slight enough to be an elf, so it's probably a human or a half elf. He takes the time to cut the body down from where it's hanging along the wall. He checks the body, and as it has no clothes and no skin, he surprisingly doesn't find anything. He brings the body down, and says that if anyone wants to do something with it they can. He then returns to the top of the tower, rolling a perception check. The forest seems slightly more quiet and eerie, due to his innate druidic connection to nature. Things feel tense. The creatures around here seem to be subdued in some way. He stays where he is to keep an eye out for potential danger.
Aleya puts the flayed body in the manticore room to burn with the others.
Jhen is sitting against the stable wall, near to Robin. Ganraz approaches him, asking Jhen about the wolfmen. He wants to know if they are "agreeable" to people like us, and Jhen says the best word to describe them is "independent". He hasn't been in that area for about a decade, as he found his calling elsewhere. They are fierce, but loyal to one another, and also to those who are useful. Ganraz asks if they'd work with us if we had a common enemy. Jhen says it is possible, although they don't typically have the best relations with outsiders.
Brande joins the others by the campfire that the others set up. He tells them that Tine Siorei has spoken once more. He uses Silent Image to make the flames of the campfire spread out, and begin forming into the images he saw before. Gareth can't see this, he's on top of the tower. Although Angelo isn't by the fire, he is close enough to see it. He rolls a history check, but rolls low, so he offers no comment.
Robin comments on how impressive Brande's fire tricks are. She asks if we're going to bed any time soon. Brande apologises if he disturbed her, after what she's experienced.
Ganraz and Angelo take first watch, Vilgrim, Gareth and Seamus take second, Brande and Aleya take last.
Angelo sets up Leomund's Tiny Hut. He rolls a 16 on his perception, and Ganraz rolls 15. Neither of them notice anything. Ganraz checks in on how Angelo is doing. Angelo tells Ganraz that he didn't exactly sign up for any of this craziness, and doesn't imagine anyone else did either. Ganraz agrees that no, he has signed up for some weird shit. Angelo tells him that he's got some things to decide; he needs to do before he is allowed to die, so he would prefer to not get taken out by a cult of hobgoblins. But he also doesn't feel it's right to just abandon the group, so he's conflicted. He then asks Ganraz how he's doing, after having seen him take a terrifying amount of damage, which he says is very impressive. Ganraz says the strategy is to stay alive and kill everything. Solid strategy.
Vilgrim, Gareth and Seamus see Jhen leaving the bubble, saying he's going to take a walk. Vilgrim asks Gareth if he's familiar with any plants he's seen, and if he might mind pointing out any poisonous plants to Vilgrim. Gareth does a big ole HMMM, and rolls an insight check, because that's a weird thing to ask for. Vilgrim tries to insist that he'd never use it on the party [Nobody believes you Vilgrim, the players all rolled nat 20s on their insight], and says it would be useful to incapacitate enemies. Jhen returns from his walk.
Brande and Aleya take last watch, and they don't seem to see anything. Aleya boils some water, and tosses some leaves in. She offers a cup to Brande, who is understandably wary after having gotten very drunk at the tavern. It is just tea however, so it helps them to both wake up. He thanks her for the cloak to keep him warm, and she shrugs, it's the least she could do.
We all wake up, and the day is ours. Gareth takes his job seriously, and goes looking for poisonous plants to give to Vilgrim. He finds some berries, and it's here that we discover Gareth has -1 Nature, despite being a druid. So, after having an abysmal couple of rolls, he decides to eat one to test it. Everything's fine for about 5 minutes, and then the left side of his face begins to go slack, feeling completely numb. He gives the berries to Vilgrim. [Nearly didn't write all this down because I had tears from laughing]
We pass by the hydra area. As we do so, Aleya takes the opportunity to tell the party that we might need to be cautious on our way back, as the wargs that passed us could be spying on Drellin's Ferry. The enemy knows we're alive for sure, so we have a look around for prints. It doesn't look like any wargs have been this way.
As we reach where we turned onto the Dawn Way, Jorr stops. He says that he'd prefer to stay in the witchwood, as it's his home. He hands us a note, saying "I also saw what they saw. There was a dragon. Jorr". He thinks he'll be most help staying within his own territory. He reckons he might be able to find some people to help him cause trouble for any enemies coming through. Ganraz tells him to look after himself first and foremost, and Jorr says he's got his dogs to do that for him. He tells us that we should get the caravan to Brindal.
We part ways with Saint Jorr the Mighty.

{[h]Back in Drellin's Ferry}
We continue on, breaking out of the treeline, and we come out at the north side of Drellin's Ferry. We can see that a lot of the camp has already been broken down, although some tents remain. The ferry is moving across the river. Further up the road we can see guards stationed at the guard post. There appears to be activity in the town still.
We all roll perception checks. We can see a wagon train starting to be formed, and it's slightly larger than the previous one. It's on the far side of town. As we move further down the road, some guards move to intercept us.
[Quick break here]
We don't recognise the guards, and they both look kind of young. Ill-fitting armour. He asks us to state our business. Everyone stands there in silence for a moment; we're beaten up, bloody, tattered, and too tired to be bothered with this shit. We keep walking forwards, and Ganraz tells him however that we're returning from the mission Captain Surana gave them. One of the guards turns to the other and whispers, in awe, "These are the Breakers?" He then runs off to tell the Guard Captain we're here.
Brande: They don't train them very well, do they?
Aleya: I'll bet you he'll be dead before the year is out.
Hersk is at the ferry. He escorts us onto the ferry, and asks us if we really saw a dragon. People are staring as we get off the ferry. Lots of whispers of "It's the Breakers". Brande leans towards Angelo and asks whether he's missed something, he doesn't understand why everyone's saying it. Angelo remarks that we seem to have picked up a moniker of sorts whilst we've been absent. Aleya says that she hates it. Angelo agrees.
Aleya casts Detect Magic, but not as a ritual. It sets some people on edge. Hersk warns her to maybe not make people nervous, and calls her m'lady. Oops, watch yourself Hersk.
We meet with Surana, and she tells us that there will be a town meeting tonight, which is where we'll give our report. It's getting towards evening now. We've probably got about 2 hours before nightfall. Ganraz fills her in on the mission to the keep, and tells her that that job is definitely complete. She says she can retrieve our pay, if that's what we want. She also says that there will be a slight change.
She leads us inside, taking us into a large meeting chamber. There's a big chest set on the table, and a set of leather armour. There are 650 each, and they've had to make some last minute expenditures, so she hopes that the armour will be suitable as trade. It is apparently a heritage item, and although it's a leather armour, it looks kind of like bark. The armour is enchanted, which Aleya can detect. It's +1 leather armour, known as Overgrowth armour. Although Angelo was initially interested, it seems to suit Gareth's aesthetic best, so he gets that instead.
We have a couple of hours free. Surana says that there are a lot of sensational stories about us, and that Markos is doing his best to get the caravan ready to move off by tomorrow morning. She acknowledges that if what we say is true, then we have done them a service. She says that the most prominent members of the town will be present at the meeting, including the town speaker, as well as the Cristole party. Ganraz asks if she would prefer if we keep quiet before the meeting, and she says that yes, she'd like to keep things controlled until we need to leave Drellin's Ferry. Brande asks her what "Breakers" means, and she confirms Angelo's earlier assumption that it's a moniker that the people have given us.
Ganraz asks her before we leave if the phrase Ghostlord means anything to her. She says that yes, it's something to keep children from being bad. Perhaps Kellin would be good to ask. Everyone but Gareth gets 650 gold, whilst Gareth grabs the armour.
Angelo and Aleya want to get rooms at the tavern. Vilgrim tries to sneak off by himself, but Angelo notices him leaving. The rest of us head towards The Old Bridge Inn. As we walk, we see Jast walking towards us.
He's heard a thing or two about us, and says everything's busy. He asks where the small one is, and Angelo begins to tell him that Vilgrim does just sort of disappear whenever he feels like it, but Ganraz talks over him and tells him that VILGRIM'S DEAD. Jast also tells Seamus that Merahl(?) has taken to swordplay. He's very enthusiastic about hitting things. Tressa has apparently been giving Elaine a bit of trouble, but not much.
Ganraz and Angelo buy the really nice rooms in the tavern, paying 10 gold each, because they have baths in as well as the double beds. Having a bath and washing his hair is the first thing Angelo wants to do. Seamus goes to say hello to Markos, and check out the forge to make Ganraz's armour that he promised him. Ganraz goes with him to check it out with him.
Vilgrim gets away from the rest of the party, and does his best to become more inconspicuous. He rubs a bit of dirt into this cloak, tries to make himself look a little more scruffy. He then moves to the poorer part of town, hoping to look for people who might give him information. He rolls for investigation, and it's 16. He sees a couple of old guys sitting at a table outside a farmstead. He approaches, and asks if he can watch the game of dragonchess they're playing. Vilgrim asks them if they've seen anyone suspicious around, and they say a woman did see some shadowy figure. [Didn't catch the name, I was focused on Angelo's notes] They also say that there's someone called Certian(?) who lives in the manor house can use magic.
Angelo sprints to the room he's just bought and has a bath. He's not there for a luxurious long bath, he just wants to be clean again. He then changes into fresh clothes, leaves his slightly tattered side cape upstairs. Once this is done, he leaves items that are not immediately important in his room.
Aleya orders her drinks, and Kellin asks her to tell him some stories about our adventures. She tells him a very basic, blunt story about how we nearly died several times and a dragon was there. He doesn't think she's one to lie, so he says that he'll probably be skipping town too soon.
Lady Elise is sitting on one of the tables, and Itaan is with her. She appears to be writing a letter. She notices that we seem to be in a bit of a hurry so she doesn't call us over. Aleya goes upstairs to have a bath, and then once she's done she goes to the graveyard to pay her respects.
Ganraz returns to the tavern and asks Kellin about the Ghostlord. Apparently, he's a bit of a boogeyman around here, and Kellin gives Ganraz a bit of a theatrical retelling. There was a once proud druid, who dwelt in what is now known as the Thornwaste. He lead several tribes of nomads, who build a statue in honour of him. Nobles arrived in the region, and the nomads who befriended them were betrayed. The visitors killed a lion (considered sacred), and the druids retaliated, and this sparked a small war between them. The mighty leader was killed between the paws of the stone lion, and the next night everyone related to the attack in Rhest were slain. The Ghostlord is supposedly the angry spirit of the killed druid leader. [This is a bit sketchy,
Angelo comes down from his bath, freshly cleaned and dressed, fresh eyeliner applied, smelling of lavender. Itaan waves him over. They're both pleased to see the bard back in one piece. Angelo anticipated that people might not believe that we had truly seen a dragon, so he takes out one of the dragon scales to show Itaan. She's writing to Lord Kerden Jarmaath, the lord Paramount of the region, lord of Brindal. She's telling him that the caravan may be arriving a bit earlier than expected, and that she would like to describe the party's discovery, and count Angelo as one of her companions. She asks him for his full name, and he tells her that his real name is Angelo, and Soliloquy is the name he's using, and would prefer to keep. She accepts that, and says she's happy to count him as an ally. He also points out that he's willing to work alongside her as an ally, but he might not be around long enough to work as a permanent agent of House Cristole.
She also offers to make Angelo a glamourweave cape, as she notices that his is missing. He plays it cool and graciously accepts, but internally he's like a kid whose Christmas has just come early. [Details to be worked out later]
Aleya goes to buy some ink and paper for her spells. Whilst she's walking around town, she'll throw detect magic up again just to keep an eye out. She does notice one noble looking guy has an item on him, and he seems to be in a huff, but she doesn't see anything else.
[There's some geography stuff here because Vilgrim asked the DM but I haven't written it all down]

{[h]The Meeting}
We all gather again for the meeting. We're back in the room where we received payment. Captain Surana. Kellin. A woman in her 50s called Delora Zaan(?) (she owns the stable), a tall sour-faced man (who Aleya recognises to be the guy who pinged with magic) wearing a small ruff around his neck, Iorsomething(?) [I don't care enough about this snooty bish to remember his name]. Itaan. Lady Elise. Norro the town speaker. Markos.
Norro looks a bit nervous. He says he's been given a copy of the report, and is anxious that there seems to be a larger force of hobgoblins than what they expected. He asks us to give a full report.
Angelo glances at Ganraz, as he's the pseudo-leader of the group, wondering if he should speak or if Ganraz will do it. Ganraz does start, explaining how we stormed Vraath's Keep, and tells them about Wyrmlord Koth. Aleya backs him up by putting the notes on the table. Ganraz continues, telling them about our travel to the bridge, and us finding out that Ozyrrendion is actually a big green dragon. Angelo backs him up by putting the three green scales on the table as proof. Itaan chimes in to verify they are indeed dragon scales. Ganraz finishes, recounting the destruction of the bridge, and tells them that the caravan will be moving on to safety, and would advise that the people of Drellin's Ferry do the same.
Noble douchebag still doesn't believe us after all of this, and scoffs at the story. He says that maybe we should just give them jewels or something. When we insist that won't work, he says that maybe the town should just stand up against the hobgoblin rabble. Delora says that she's seen towns put to the sword before, and wouldn't want the same before.
Noble douchebag wants to know whether or not we're telling the truth, and still seems pretty miffed that his business will be disrupted. Angelo is kind of annoyed at this noble douchebag, so he takes out his Tiamat pendant and asks Itaan to explain the lore behind it to the table. Itaan is very excited to whip out his powerpoint presentation, so he briefly tells everyone what it means. He confirms that it definitely involves five heads of different colours.
Angelo: Can you sincerely tell the people of Drellin's Ferry that you can protect them from five dragons?
Noble douchebag: Well, no, but—
Angelo: No? Then sit down and let the adults talk.
It is generally agreed that maybe we are telling the truth, and they should protect the people of Drellin's Ferry as best as they can.

{[h]The meeting is adjourned}
Markos says it's good to see us again. His plan is to move the caravan to Brindal, and if that fails he's take them on to the next town. He intends to take them along the road through Daath. Surana says that they'll also cut the crossing at Drellin's Ferry, though it may not slow them down. She reckons it would take them at least three days to try and cross the Rhestwash. The alternative would be to travel through the wyrmsmokes, but that would take them a lot of time.
The further away from the road you get, the denser the forest, so it would be difficult to transport wagons and supplies through. Aleya asks if we could enlist the help of skilled men to try and disrupt the enemy and scout the area, which Jorr would be able to help with.
Delora says that if the force is large enough to attempt to take the whole region, it could be overwhelming. The political situation is perfect for calling for aid from Breland. Zilargo doesn't have a standing army. Denevar(?) might help. Brindal is defensible, and has an elite force known as the Lions of Brindal. She believes they have a couple of wyverns maybe. We could also call upon Jhen's people potentially.
[I'm a little to tired to keep up with all the geography and political stuff here, but essentially we do have options if we want to call for aid]
Ganraz says that his gut instinct is for the caravan to try and move to Terralton, and decide from there which route is quicker to take. Markos says he can do that, although there are some things on the map that concern him. Understandable.
Aleya asks what we know about the Darguun situation. Itaan answers, telling them lore about the main mercenary companies [found in the discord chat, I'll type it up if people want it but I'm not going to right now]; The Ebony Legion, Um'Thrak's Crew and The Mist Company. She wants the borders watched.
Markos tells us that Jhen intends to travel north, but he's not sure whether he's going to try and cross the river yet. The fastest route would be to take a boat downstream, and head to Lake Rhestin. Ganraz says that that's pretty promising. Brande agrees that having more capable warriors on our side would be good. Ganraz adds that we (as a party) seem to work well as a group, and we would probably be better served trying to slow down our enemy rather than guard the caravan. He suggests that we join Jhen.
Itaan gives Angelo a sending stone so that he can communicate with him. That brings back memories.
[Our current plan is that we will travel with Jhen to Lake Rhestin via boat, and disrupt whatever Saarvith is up to whilst also hopefully recruiting Jhen's tribe]

Our session ends here. `

{[h]Recap}
The party are in Drellin's Ferry, after having concluded their meeting with the town's officials. We are about to set out on our journey down the Elsir River towards the ruined city of Rhest. The day we leave Drellin's Ferry will be the 13th Eyre.

{[h]The session begins}
We have the time before bed to do whatever we want. Ganraz gives his splint and chainmail to the caravan. Aleya scribes the Blink spell into her spellbook, so she doesn't need the scroll anymore. Angelo and Aleya do some quick retroactive shopping for spell components. Seamus has made Ganraz's plate, and goes to bed.
Vilgrim goes off by himself again [the party is so used to it that basically no-one reacts], and finds a quiet spot. After looking around to make sure no-one is nearby [rolls a nat 20], he can see that he's garnered some attention from the townspeople. However, no-one's followed him, which is what he was focused on. He takes out a stone from his
"Apologies for wait. Major incident. Encountered hobgoblin vanguard. Forces neutralised. Followed leader to Skull Gorge. Found dragon. Repeat, dragon. Hobgoblin army gathering." He waits for a few minutes, used to not getting an immediate response, and then a female voice comes through. "Corvair, you continue to pay your debts. Report regularly. Information on the hobgoblin force is key. The Zil(?) listen."

{[h]In the morning}
It's a surprisingly warm morning. Lots of people are gathering, as there's a large caravan forming of both refugees and townspeople. Some barges are drifting away down the river to try and get towards Brindal. We go towards a specific jetty, which Surana had already told us to go to. People are trying to bring everything they can with them [it's a Rohan-style exodus].
The noble we met from earlier is struggling to get his bag strapped securely. None of us help him. He's trying to get his men to help him but they're busy being good people.
At the jetty, there's a small retinue of people waiting for us, including Elaine and the kids. Surana gestures for us to join them. There are two sleek rowboats, and although we could all cram into one, it's probably best to spread out. The guard captain tells us that they're sturdy, and should do well when we hit the Rhestwash. Jhen knows the region, and knows what to look out for. She then tells us that we should look out for some creatures to the east [the direction we're going], because there's a reason the townspeople don't go to Lake Rhestin anymore.
Behind us, we see the people cutting the ferry. At least when they come back, they can restore it.
Our provisions are already in the boats. She then asks if there's anything else that we need from her. Ganraz says that we have everything we need.
Boat 1: Ganraz, Vilgrim, Jhen, Gareth. Jhen takes one of the oars.
Boat 2: Aleya, Brande, Angelo, Seamus.
Brande is feeling pretty good, because he thinks it'll be like the ferry. It is, however, a bit unstable, and it's more water than he's been on before.
Markos says that we have no need to look glum, as he wishes he was going adventuring with us. Although age prevents him, as does the loss of most of his limbs. He is of course very grateful to Seamus.
Merahl is trying to copy Ganraz's powerful stance, as he's got a toy sword and he's trying to hold it the way Ganraz is. Brande approaches him, and crouches to talk to him. He asks him about wanting to be a warrior, and [forms a pact between an 8 year old and a demon] engraves his toy sword for him. Seamus goes over to get hugs, and promises to give Tressa another invention. Elaine tells us to be safe, and laughs at Seamus' new nickname, "Iron Arms." Apparently, we all have one. Oh no.
Markos approaches Angelo, and gives him a green bundle that's neatly wrapped. There's a note attached. Angelo reads the note. "A token of our affection.." It's motherfucking glamourweave, boiiii. He's very excited, but chooses not to put it on yet.
Markos then looks at everyone else, and says, "What are you waiting for, a kiss?" Angelo blows him a kiss as he goes back to help with the boats.
Jhen reckons we'll spend about 12 hours on the water. Two days to reach the lake, and another day or so to reach the black fens. [Each boat has 60 hit points]

{[h]We're off }
The sun glistens on the surface of the water. Some people wave us off before they join the caravan, which is now moving away towards Brindal. Ganraz is worried about them as we leave.
Jhen calls out that this section of water is slow-flowing, so we probably won't have any problem.
Ganraz, Jhen, Vilgrim and Gareth are in The Competent, with Ganraz and Jhen rowing. Aleya, Brande, Angelo and Seamus in The Other Boat, with Aleya and Angelo rowing.
Brande is surprised by the amount of water around them, having never been on a boat before. [Ganraz wants to say something to Angelo, but can't yet, so the Scribe will remember this]. Vilgrim decides he wants to draw Gnaraz like one of his Breland girls. Aleya has taken off most of her armour, because it makes sense whilst she rows.
Brande turns to Seamus and asks him how good he is at making things quiet. He has some armor that's good at keeping him safe but isn't good at making him stealthy. Seamus says he can have a look, but he'd need time and somewhere to work to make something of it.
The first few hours pass. The trees are getting a little more dense on either side of the river. The water is getting a little faster. Jhen shouts out that there will be a couple more hours, and then we'll hit the Rhestwash. Vilgrim has noticed that there are some water birds nearby. Angelo shows Brande how to row.
[We take a quick break]
The water is getting a little faster, and seems to cut into the land. There are hills rising around us as we follow the river further downstream. We're mostly steering at this point rather than rowing.

{[h]Quick stop}
When we stop for lunch and a piss, Ganraz asks Angelo for a favour; he wants Angelo to keep him posted about Elaine and the kids when he uses the sending stone to Itaan. Angelo agrees, asking if there's anything in particular that he wants him to ask. Ganraz says no, and Angelo makes a mental note.
Gareth asks Jhen about the area we're headed to. Jhen and his sister were known to stray from the pack. Jhen gives some lore about the land that his tribe lives in, and says there are some dangerous creatures around, such as poisonous frogs. Vilgrim is interested, and asks him to describe them. As Vilgrim has openly asked about poisonous animals, Angelo sarcastically asks if there are any venomous snakes too, as Vilgrim likes those too. Jhen says there are some. Ganraz asks if there's any poisonous berries that Gareth should avoid.
Jhen says that with his presence, the tribe should be at least amenable to meeting. We wouldn't be able to find them without him.

{[h]Back on the water}
The river starts to become thinner. Jhen calls out that this is the Rhestwash. Aleya takes the oar from Brande.
The Competent all roll athletics checks, and Ganraz is frustrated with his dice. The boats are getting separated, so Ganraz tosses a rope to The Other Boat. Angelo inspires Brande, but Brande catches it without expending his inspiration. The Other Boat roll athletics checks, and they do ok. Aleya starts rowing faster to try and stay level, so the other rowers keep pace. Brande is still holding this rope.
We actually get some air, and splash back down. Brande is getting rope burn. He does try and hold on, but the rope gets yanked out his hands, and he takes 4 points of damage. That was about half an hour of rapid rowing. The river has widened a bit now. It's getting into the evening now, and we have about 2 more hours until we reach the camp spot.
We all roll perception checks. Aleya gets highest, with a 24. She sees a heron take off, past the reeds on the west bank. It's about 100ft in front of her. There's
Brande: These rivers are quite exciting, aren't they?
Aleya: Brande, shut up.
She tells everyone in our boat to be quiet, and sends Ganraz a message to warn him. She reaches for her sword, which alerts everyone in her boat. There's another ripple about 20ft away from Ganraz's boat. Then the whole boat shakes.
Everyone in Ganraz's boat has to roll a dex save. Ganraz gets 20. Vilgrim gets 23. Jhen gets 16. Gareth gets xx. Everyone seems to be fine.

{[h]Roll for initiative}
Initiative order: Crocodile 1, Aleya, Angelo, Jhen, Brande, Crocodile 2, Ganraz, Vilgrim, Seamus
The Competent has taken 3 points of damage. A large crocodile appears. It decides to tail slap the boat, aiming for both Jhen and Vilgrim. It misses Jhen, but hits Vilgrim. He dodges, and makes a strength check, but fails. Though he takes no damage, the tail does just clip him, and knocks him into the water. Crocodile 1 then lunges up onto the boat, taking a bite at Ganraz. He deals 43 damage, because the DM rolled a nat 20.
Aleya isn't within melee range, but she deals 15 damage with Magic Missile.
Angelo lets go of the oar and takes out his wand, also casting Magic Missile and dealing 16 damage. The crocodile looks annoyed and a bit hurt, but doesn't let go of Ganraz. Angelo then yells across, "Stay alive until the other thing is dead" and casts Healing Word, giving him 11hp back.
Jhen shifts into a more wolfish form, stepping forwards and trying to break the crocodile's hold. He rolls a 15 strength, so it doesn't work.
Brande uses his Sharpshooter, dealing 15 damage. It looks a bit bloodied.
At this point, we see over to our right another crocodile rushing towards us. It sinks into the water.
Ganraz tries to break the grapple, but can't, so he uses Second wind to give himself 11 hp back.
Vilgrim swims back to the boat, clambering back up. He then takes out his bow, trying to shoot at the crocodile holding onto Ganraz. He deals 24 damage. It is looking pretty hurt, but still holds onto Ganraz.
Seamus reaches out with his left arm, and two ribbons of iron extend out and grapple the other boat. Seamus uses this to leap off of The Other Boat and land on The Competent.
Crocodile 1 drags Ganraz into the water [the party groans] and then uses its action to use Death Roll [the party groans again]. It deals 23 bludgeoning damage. [Ganraz's player fucking hates dnd]
Aleya sees Ganraz go in, and uses Magic Missile on it again, dealing 16 damage. She then action surges to do it again, dealing 15 damage. The crocodile is definitely dead. Ganraz's world stops spinning, and he's surrounded by red. Aleya then turns to Angelo, telling him that they're probably not very clever, so he should cast an illusion.
Angelo isn't going to argue; he casts Major Image, creating an identical boat to the one they're on, and puts it between them and the crocodile. He makes it appear as if the boat is trying to flee. He then shouts to Seamus, "Get Ganraz!" and bardicly inspires him.
Brande shoots at the other crocodile, and deals 15 damage.
Crocodile 2 breaches the water, snapping at the fake boat, and then sinks down again, confused.
Ganraz tries to swim up, but he's disoriented by blood and his heavy armour is making it hard to swim.
Vilgrim hands Seamus and Jhen a rope, and tries to shoot at Crocodile 2.
Seamus grapples Ganraz, iron bands wrapping around his chest, and Seamus has to roll a strength check to get him up without being dragged in himself. He has advantage, and bardic inspiration.
Aleya did specify earlier on that she wasn't wearing much armour, so she jumps in and swims round to help Ganraz. She makes it to him.
Jhen paddles to keep The Competent under control.
Brande uses Hex on the crocodile. He then rolls a nat 20, plus his bardic inspiration. He deals 25 points of piercing damage.
Crocodile 2 chases the fake boat, which is lucky for the two illusionists in the lead boat. A third crocodile slowly joins the fray.
Ganraz tries to climb up, but rolls a 2. He action surges and tries again, managing to climb out this time.
Vilgrim aims at Crocodile 3, dealing 6 damage. He then braces himself to make sure he doesn't get knocked out again.
Seamus pulls Aleya out of the water too.
Aleya dives back into the water, swimming back to the other boat. She uses her action to try and climb up into the boat. She manages it, scrambling in. Brande asks her if she had a nice swim. Aleya doesn't deign to reply.
Jhen, seeing that we're all back in boats, starts paddling faster. He yells at us to paddle faster, to get out of their territory.
Brande tries to shoot at Crocodile 2 again, but just missed.
Crocodile 3 makes his way to the body of Croc 1 and starts tearing off bits of meat. Croc 2 does the same. Angelo drops his Major Image, and helps Aleya paddle so we can get out of here quicker. Brande helps out, he's learning to not be a fan of lizards.

{[h]We survived the crocodiles}
Everyone's a bit rattled, but we begin to move on. It's about 6 or 7 now. Jhen directs us, and we row tiredly towards the bank. Brande rolls a perception check, and it looks like it's mostly safe now.
Angelo sets up the bubble, and we all camp. Brande uses Cure Wounds, giving him 10 hp back. Aleya sets up a wire around the hut. She tells Brande and Angelo that they did good.
Brande and Angelo take first watch, and it's mostly uneventful. There is a lone wolf that comes and looks around a bit, but then pads off into the forest again. Brande then asks Angelo if all rivers are this dangerous. Angelo says it depends on the area, and Brande reveals his secret; he can't swim. But he asks Angelo to keep it between them, as the party probably don't suspect a thing. Angelo says he can probably teach Brande some basic swimming, just for survival, but he won't teach him anything in crocodile-infested waters.
Vilgrim and Jhen take second watch, and Jhen points out a bird to Vilgrim. It's BIG, 15ft. Jhen says we're getting closer. Vilgrim asks if everything around this area are that large. Jhen says that he's hunted Boar Crocodiles before, and that not everything in this area is that big but there are lot of dangerous things. Jhen leans in, and goes hoooo. The bird he saw was probably a giant owl.
Ganraz and Aleya take last watch, and Aleya is concerned by the wolf when the message is passed on. She thinks that a wolf hanging around for a while is suspect, and thinks it could be a scout from the Red Hand. Ganraz follows her logic, but says there isn't really anything we can do about it other than be vigilant. Aleya is still concerned, as if we're being watched we could meet greater resistance. Ganraz lets her know that his gut tells him that the wolf isn't connected to our enemies. Aleya also is suspicious about something else, but her player thinks it's too meta, so she doesn't say anything.
As the sun begins to rise, we all wake up, and we find that there's a low fog hanging over the area. Aleya tells Ganraz to keep watch, and goes over to check the water. It's murky, less clear than it was in the mountains. She has a quick bath. We eat, and get back in our boats.

{[h]Rowing again}
[It's 14th Eyre today]
The forest begins to clear on the lefthand side. There's another river, joining ours. We all roll perception, and those who rolled over 15 can see a orange glow through the fog. Jhen sees this, and mutters something under his breath, and casts pass without trace. He presses a finger to his lips, and slowly paddles through the fog. Both boats keep close together.
We roll another perception check as the orange glow gets closer, and a stealth check with it. We can make out silhouettes, lots of them, about 600 meters off. There's hundreds and hundreds of tents. Trees are being felled, and dragged around. They seem to be making rudimentary rafts. We're all staying low and in a bank of fog.
Closer to our side of the river, we can see draconic-looking wolves, like reptilian dogs but larger. Two groups of four. There are some silhouettes that are MUCH larger than the others, and there are lots of them. It looks like they have some sort of giants with them. There appear to be clouds of flying creatures swirling over the trees. Aleya is the only one who notices, when she looks up, that two larger wings form through the cloud.
We have officially seen the horde of the Red Hand.
We roll another stealth check. The draconic wolf creatures don't appear to notice us. We can see giant flying creatures. The sprawl of tent cuts through the woodland, hard to count, but hundreds. Aleya tries to estimate exactly how many there are. She believes there are at least 7000, probably more. There are at least 50 giants. Two dragons seem to be circling, one green, one red.
Aleya whispers her estimates to Angelo and Brande.
And as we paddle away, sneaking off into the fog and reeling from the forces amassed against us, we end the session here. `

[The boat names have been changed to The Competent (Ganraz, Jhen, Vilgrim and Gareth) and The Basa (Brande, Aleya, Seamus and Angelo) but I haven't changed it on the other notes yet]
[In this session, Aleya is played by James, so if she seems uncharacteristically friendly that's why]

{[h]Still on the river}
[It's still 14th Eyre today]
The glow of campfires begin to dim as they are left behind us. We let the river's current carry us, gliding silently, and after maybe 10 minutes we finally hear the shouts and crashes behind us fade away. We can finally relax. The fog is beginning to also burn away.
Vilgrim says that he would very much like to get away from the horde as possible. Everyone else agrees, and Jhen paddles slowly. [From where we are, we know it'll probably be another day's travel to reach Lake Rhestin. Then another day to get a good distance into the Blackfens, where Jhen's tribe will be]
Jhen says that he'd heard of our fight with the dragon, but is still startled by the sight of real dragons.
Angelo gets out the sending stone now, just in case he doesn't get the chance to later on. ‘Enemy is building rafts. Aleya estimates seven thousand foot soldiers, maybe more. Two dragons, several giants…' He pauses, glances at the other boat, and then finishes with, ‘Please check on Elaine and the children for me.'
He then asks Brande and Seamus to take over rowing, so that he can talk to Aleya privately.
There is a long pause, because it's like 6 in the morning, but Itaan replies. ‘I shall pass that on. Day away from Terrelten. The children are safe. Riders report Rhest trail blocked. Jaarmath has declared an emergency, made Bridal safe. Good luck.' Angelo passes that on to The Basa's crew, and Aleya messages Ganraz to tell the others.
Seamus says he's read something about giants, but he didn't expect to see so many in one place. Jhen agrees that it's weird, seeing as the giant who live in the Wyrmsmokes are fractured. Bringing them all together would take some will, and would probably take a long time. We ponder what has united them.
Angelo, being proficient in history, rolls. He gets a 16, and knows that the giants were mainly based in Zendrik(?). Mostly smaller giant-variants were more prone to wandering further afield. The most common giant to encounter would be a hill giant. Hill giants are usually dumb and hungry, and they respect whoever is the fattest, biggest and strongest. They're also matriarchal. They tend to operate in very small tribes. We could probably trick them without having to fight them.
Jhen says that we'll make Lake Rhestin by nightfall. Vilgrim asks where he thinks we can make camp. Jhen thinks that the banks are moderately safe, but venturing closer to the city is dangerous. He also informs us that the dangers to look out for include lizard people in the marshes, both green and black scaled. Brande asks what the difference is, and Jhen says that the green are ambushers whilst the black will just rush you. Vilgrim says he's had a run in with those people before, and they're not very civilised. Jhen's tribe were on relatively good terms with the people of Rhest, who left the Longclaw tribe to chill in the woods and police the land. Then the fall of Rhest happened 300 years ago. The Longclaw tribe have stayed in the area, keeping an eye on the ruined city and the dangerous creatures in the marshes. Ganraz asks if the tribe have ever tried to undo the flooding of Rhest, but the tribe aren't adept in the arcane.
When Jhen left his tribe, Celia(?) was the Star Singer, and he says she earned that position in the tribe. Ganraz asks what that is. It's what we would consider the wisest elder, an advisor. It's not a concrete leader though; the advice is usually respected, but it's not the same as giving orders. The tribe was also 500 – 600 strong when he left.
Ganraz tells Jhen to take the lead, and we'll just follow. Brande asks if there's anything we should do, any behaviours we should exhibit. Jhen lets us know that they aren't hostile to outsiders, and the tribe are willing to trade, and we will most likely all need to speak for ourselves unless we elect a leader.
We have about ten more hours of rowing. Not heavy rowing, but it's going to be a long one.


[The following is all meta knowledge, as it's only between Angelo and Aleya and they're talking via message, but I'm including it here so that the conversation isn't lost. Also, pretend there's the "You can reply to this message" after everything Aleya says, I just didn't bother typing it]
Angelo: I've been thinking about that puzzle you gave me… The one about Vilgrim's mystery item.
Aleya: What about it?
Angelo: I thought it might have been that ring he found in the same tomb where you got your sword of destiny, but then remembered that he gave it to Ganraz.
Aleya: It's not the ring. Wrong type of magic. I have an idea of what it is, but honestly don't fucking know enough about the arcane.
Angelo: So, it must be something we've never seen Vilgrim using. I've thought about it some more, and if you'll humour me, I have two theories.
Aleya: Your thoughts being?
Angelo: It could be one of two things. It might be something passive, like a protective charm, in which case we naturally wouldn't see him using it because it doesn't need to be activated to work. Option 2, and the more likely scenario, in my opinion… it's something he doesn't want us to see him using.
Aleya: Undoubtedly option 2 is more likely. But we all have our own secrets, and I honestly don't give a shit about most of them.
Angelo: (He then holds out the sending stone Itaan gave him) How accurate is your magic detection thing? Do you think his item is similar to this?
Aleya: It's the same type of magic, and I have a suspicion that it is the same. Which means he's probably working for someone else. I don't like that.
Angelo: Mm, no, I'm not keen on the idea myself. If I may ask, how long have you thought that? Do you know if Ganraz thinks the same?
Aleya: A while now. But nothing so concrete until recently. No-one with his talents obtains them through sitting around with a bird. It's obvious he was involved in the last war, and his skillset is suited to one particular role. Ganraz knows. But not about the sending stone.
Angelo: (He's impressed but not surprised by how much Aleya has noticed) What about me?
Aleya: Well, you're not old enough to have much experience in combat. And honestly, you don't look like it either. But you're clearly educated and have had extensive schooling. Itaan seems to trust you more, so you probably have some connection there. You dress better than most, so you were probably raised in a somewhat wealthy place or you need to in order to get by. If the latter, then you probably con people to get money (Angelo scoffs at this). Kind of makes sense given the magic you use, the fact that you don't like Vilgrim for some reason, and the fact that you clearly don't trust people. If I had to make a guess then Vilgrim probably has some information on you. You have two notebooks, so one is probably for stuff you don't want other people to know. You don't fight directly, which at least means you're not stupid. But you always try to stay far enough away that you can run. Sensible, but if I had to make a guess, you're either scared of death or have someone you don't want to leave. Either way, I don't really care unless it compromises our chances. Does that answer your question?
Angelo: (He thinks for a moment, and then kind of smiles) I had no idea I was so interesting to you. I thought you despised me. If you're curious, my only real connection to Itaan is that we're both from Cyre. Other than that, I'd never met the man until we both joined the caravan. And I know my word probably isn't worth much to you, but I don't intend any harm to anyone here, if that's what you were concerned about. I'm here mostly by accident.
Aleya: (She gives a small laugh) I make a point of getting an idea about those I have to travel with. If you're going into a fight you want to know that the people with you can be relied upon. Outside of that, people can do whatever the fuck they want as long as they don't expect me to get them out of it. Anyway, you haven't done enough to make me hate you.
Angelo: You're right, I don't trust people much. In my experience it's far safer. But, I won't just run off, I do have some rules that I live by. For example, it wouldn't have been right to leave you and Ganraz at the bridge, so I stayed.
Aleya: Liking each other isn't necessary anyway. It's more that, no offense, but you look like the least useful person out of us for what we're facing (Angelo places a hand over his heart as if she's mortally wounded him). But appearances can be deceiving. Not trusting people is safer. I learned that pretty quickly and have had it hammered home too many times.
Angelo: (Grinning) I do trust you somewhat. I trust that, when you've finally had enough of me, you'll tell me to my face that you're going to kill me before you do it.
Aleya: And give you warning? Why would I give away the advantage? I'm not foolish enough to obey shit like honour in combat. Always presume that an enemy isn't going to fight fair.
Angelo: (He's thoroughly amused by that answer) Hopefully, we shall never come to that. I've been very cordial, despite apparently being "useless". I only asked because I find it better to know exactly where I stand with you and Ganraz. Because, despite my height advantage, I have no doubt you could break me in half with your bare hands.
Aleya: Can't speak for Ganraz, but I don't think you need to worry about me trying to kill you any time soon. You're doing a decent job of keeping us alive. Useful at distracting people as well. Just continue to do what you've been doing and we'll be fine.
Angelo: I shall endeavour to do so. My particular magical abilities may be woefully underappreciated but I'm glad at least someone recognises they're useful. You're quite fantastic to watch in combat, by the way, with your glowing sword and lightning playing in your raven hair. Very impressive.
Aleya: (Insight check but he's sincerely trying to pay her a compliment) Thanks, I guess. I wish I knew more. Some of the people I've worked with in the past could do so much more. The bridge would've been so much easier to deal with…
Angelo: (Sees she looks pretty sad) Ah…
Aleya: But they're all gone now, and there's no fucking point wishing for things that are impossible. Waste of bloody time.
Angelo: It won't matter, I suppose, but I know that feeling. Well, in any case, I uh, I'm glad you're still here with us. We'd probably all be long dead by now if not for you and Ganraz.
Aleya: I'm surprised we're still alive. I thought I was going to die on that bridge, but it went better than I was expecting.
Angelo: …Do you know, I think this is the longest conversation we've had without bickering over something or you telling me to shut up.
Aleya: Not like there's much else to do right now.


Angelo has a look around, knowing that this area is supposedly good for fishing. He sees a few abandoned fishing huts and jetties, a couple more of those crocodiles, but they seem to be more slow-moving in the morning, and it's getting towards mid-morning so it's getting warmer. There's one jetty that looked maybe useable.
Ganraz thanks all of his helpers for not letting him drown. Brande says he's sure that Ganraz would do the same for any of us.
We all roll perception checks, but nothing immediately jumps to our attention.
Vilgrim has to roll a d20. The DM says, "Ok, good to know."
We're all travelling mostly quietly. Brande takes out his pan flute, playing a few songs and telling some stories of his tribe. A few highlights; his transition into becoming an adolescent/main member of the tribe, how he killed a salamander [the party interjects, clarifying that it was one of the big ones and not a tiny baby one]. The various positions within the tribe, the requirements of each member, having good control over their tine/soul, etc. [Whilst Brande is talking, the DM starts rolling dice, I see you bish]. Vilgrim asks him about weapons, and Brande elaborates on how they make their own weapons, including obsidian glass.
Ganraz asks why Brande is here. He knows it sounds rude, but he wonders why he left his tribe. Brande tells him that Tine Siorei (It's been over a week, I've forgotten how to spell it) sent him a vision. Ganraz asks if that's common. Brande elaborates, saying that he didn't expect a fire god to come and send him on a quest.
He begins to show us the original vision he had using Silent Image.
{[h]Brande's Story}
One night Brande had visions. A sea of endless fire was swirling around him. He was used to fire, and normally it had little effect on him, but this fire was different. It was hot. It felt as though he was constantly being burnt by it.
Looking out over the sea of fire, Brande saw a bright white hot spec in the distance. He then started to be pulled towards it. As it grew he realised it was a great flame - so hot that it was a blinding white. The heat from it was more than he had ever experienced. So hot that he felt as though he should have turned to steam already. The flame was so bright that even with his eyes closed all he could see is white.
When Brande was completely engulfed by the fire, his vision faded from white into a dull red. As his vision slowly came back, he saw a swirling mass of reds and oranges below him. He started to drift down towards the swirling mass. As he did he started to make out shapes. Humanoid beings all fighting in a great battle, as far as the eye could see. All kinds of spells flying from all angles, great warriors slicing others open, countless bodies on the ground. Though the entire scene itself seemed to be made of fire. The humanoids, the spells, everything just shifting shapes in an endless sea of fire.
Suddenly there was a shockwave unlike anything Brande had ever felt before - not so much an earthquake but a great change in pressure. A giant wall of smoke started expanding out from the epicentre of the shockwave. The wall seemed to be at least a mile high, but was expanding at an unnatural rate, quickly engulfing the now panicked creatures around Brande. As the smoke was about to engulf him, his vision went white once more, and he felt the searing heat from the white flame again, as he was pulled out of it, back into the endless sea that the vision had started in.
Brande turned to see another bright white flame, which he was once again pulled towards, the heat as intense and unbearable as the first. Once again he entered the white flame and saw another scene made of fire. He came to a scene of an older man, helping two small children onto a wagon, a panicked look on their faces. Behind them in the distance he could see the giant wall of smoke spreading towards them. As he starting pulling away from the scene, he could see the smoke slowly gaining in the wagon as his eyes faded to white.
Once again he was pulled out of the white flame back into the endless sea of fire. He was pulled towards a third white flame. The vision this time was of a large town of many people. The buildings there seemed hastily built, or were just large tents. It seemed to be some kind of refugee camp. Brande's vision floated through the town before coming to a a group of 5 people - most of them around Brande's size, though some on the smaller side - a halfling perhaps? Though there was something different about these 5. They glowed brighter than any others he had seen in the visions. As well as this it was hard to make out any clear features other than their silhouettes.
Brande's vision faded to white again, before being pulled out of the white flame. Brought back into the sea of fire, looking out towards the white hot flames, Brande heard a voice as if someone was talking into his ear. It said one word; "Begin."
Seamus says that he found Brande in the streets, almost getting himself killed because of the incoming mists from The Mourning. That's apparently why Brande was staring at Seamus in the street. Seamus was gathering refugees at the time to escape the village. Vilgrim says that apparently it was preordained that we would meet. Angelo offers no comment; his eyes narrow at the mention of the mists. Ganraz says he didn't believe in dragons until recently, so why not crazy fire prophecies. Brande says that it's nice to have someone looking out for you.
As he says that, we make it out onto the lake. The water appears purple in hue. The wyrmsmokes dominate the horizon to our left. To our right, there's a wetland, draped in evening shadow. There are areas where it looks like we can take boats in, but it looks very boggy. Jhen calls back that the lizard folk don't begin in earnest until much further up the lake, or further into the blackfens. The light is fading fast.
We paddle for another half an hour, and it begins to get darker. We all roll perception checks; everyone who rolled above 18, notice lights along the surface of the water. One of the lights dips below the surface. Aleya messages Ganraz, asking him if he saw that. There appears to be something in the lake. 120 feet ahead of us, two lights rise up, spiral around each other for a moment, and then sink under the water again. Jhen identifies them as lost souls. As soon as Angelo hears that, he's ready to leave.

{[h]Roll for initiative}
{[b]Initiative order:} (Jhen), Brande, Vilgrim, Seamus, Aleya, Angelo, Spirit Bois, Ganraz
There appear to be about 12 lights, but only 6 appear to be interested in us. Jhen spends his turn paddling.
Brande summons his bow but doesn't fire.
Vilgrim also readies his bow, holding his action.
Seamus spends his turn rowing in The Basa.
Aleya is also rowing The Basa.
Angelo's hand unconsciously goes to his locket. He bardicly inspires Aleya, saying, "I would like to leave quickly, please."
One of the lights darts forwards, very quickly, keeping pace with The Basa. The occupants have to all roll perception checks. Aleya can make out a haggard human face within the light, twisting between anger and sorrow. She says that we need to go quickly. Then the light disappears.
The other lights also do the same, and we all find that suspicious as fuck.
Ganraz is rowing as hard as he physically can.
Jhen stops rowing, using his turn to speak instead. "You who abandoned your posts. Flee again, leave us be." His whips out his uno reverse card with an intimidation roll. Nothing immediately happens.
Brande is up. He has gained temporary hit points.
Vilgrim was still holding his action. He doesn't really want to provoke them, so he relaxes his grip.
Aleya is still rowing.
Angelo, partly by reflex rather than conscious choice, gets ready to cast Spirit Guardians if something attacks him/The Basa.
Six lights appear. The four near The Competent back away from Jhen, but two lights remain. One of them dashes forwards towards Brande, and passes through his chest. It doesn't roll high enough against Brande's armour class, so he takes no damage. The second orb does the same for Jhen, but also nothing happens to him. Ruh roh.
Ganraz is rowing as hard as he fucking can boi, we should be paying him.
Jhen says again, "Flee this place." The lights drift away again, winking out.

{[h]We made it to shore}
The boats scrape a little along a stony beach. We're just on the edge of where the marsh begins. Jhen explains that those things were the souls of those who fled Rhest instead of staying to fight and defend it. They attempted to flee across the lake, and were caught in a storm and drowned. He says it's unusual for them to be so bold. They are known as will-o-wisps.
[Quick break for players]
Angelo sets up the bubble, and we plan our watches. Brande and Angelo are first, because Brande doesn't need as much sleep now [due to Unearthed Arcana] and Angelo is just hesitant to go to sleep. Vilgrim and Jhen are taking second. Ganraz takes last watch.
Brande and Angelo roll a 23 and 21 respectively. Angelo obviously can't leave the bubble, but Brande chills up in a tree nearby. The night starts calmly. It's warmer than before. Glancing over the waters, we do notice more lights, but they're quite far away. We think we can just make out, on the very far side of the lake, some lights, like torch lights instead of blue wisp lights. After about 20-30 minutes, the torch lights either go behind cover or are extinguished. It's vaguely in the direction of the Dawn Way. Brande climbs down to confer with Angelo, who likes the lights just as little as he likes the wisps. Angelo suggests that Brande inform Aleya and Ganraz when it gets to their watch, as it could be related to Saarvith's men.
Vilgrim and Jhen take second watch, with Brande still on duty. The genasi returns to the tree, whilst Vilgrim and Jhen sit outside of the bubble. They hear a splash in the water, and as they're reaching for weapons… they see they're giant otters. That's freaking adorable. They aren't moving towards the camp, they were just getting out of the water. Vilgrim wanted to take the opportunity for another drawing, but he's not sure about the conditions. The DM assures him that with the light reflecting off the lake, it would be ok if he wanted to sketch Brande.
Final watch is Ganraz and Jhen. Brande takes a nap inside the bubble. Before the watch ends, Vilgrim excuses himself, pretending he wants to go to the loo, and after walking 50 ft away, he pulls out his sending stone. Whilst Vilgrim's player ponders the message he wants to send, Brande fills Ganraz in on the torch lights that he and Angelo saw earlier in the night.
Vilgrim's message is: Passed assumed main hobgoblin force, camped Elsir River fork between Lake Rhestin / Skull Gorge. 50 giants, 7000, draconic canine creatures, two dragons. Any aid expected???
Ganraz gets a 27 on his perception. He notices that Jhen seems pretty tense. Ganraz can also see the flickering lights that Brande warned him of. He makes sure there's nothing around our camp to give our position away, and then checks in with Jhen. Jhen admits it's been a long time since he's returned to this area, and is worried about our reception and what might have befallen his tribe in his absence. Ganraz says that if they produced Jhen, then he's looking forward to meeting them. Jhen also acknowledges the lights on the other side of the bank, and Ganraz guesses they are scouts from the red hand. Jhen reminds him that Angelo told the group that the Rhest trail had been blocked, so the north of the Dawn Way could also be blocked. Ganraz said it's very possible, as it's the best way to cut off communication. As a side note, Jhen remarks that he would prefer to not fight with any dragons. It's generally agreed that that would not be ideal.

{[h]In the morning}
[It's 15 Eyre]
We get back into our boats, continuing our journey along the lake. To our right, the marsh really begins to take hold. Water runs between the trees. Jhen makes a note that it is possible to wade through some of this area, but he recommends staying in the boats. He also warns to not touch the water, as there are often leeches. Ew, nope, hard pass.
It's very humid, and sweat clings to us as we navigate the waters. With our passive perception, we can make out flickering lights blinking in and out of existence, but they're greens and yellows now, not wisps. It's a swarm of fireflies.
As we're moving through a section of low-hanging vines (Aleya hacks some of them away), and Jhen calls for us to stop. He points out an area of vines and says we should avoid it, so we move in a different direction. He tosses some of his rations into the vine section; the snap around the food, and then slowly draw upwards. Brande asks Jhen what he calls that – Jhen says the plant is called Assassin Vines. Angelo notes that it's an apt name. Vilgrim asks how we can recognise them, and Jhen tells us that they have little berries on their vines.
We reach a boggy area, and Jhen says it's best to leave the boats at this point. He also advises to step where he steps, and because it's his favoured terrain we won't be slowed by it.
We all roll perception checks, and only Brande got over 18. He sees Jhen pause, and follows his eyeline. A tree seems to have a large section of bark torn off. Jhen motions for us to stop, and goes to investigate it. There are four distinct marks, one slightly deeper than the rest. Brande also steps closer, rolling a survival check. Jhen says that this is not a beast he has seen before. He then asks about the acrid smell that we encountered when we fought the dragon. Brande checks, and he doesn't think it's the same as Ozzyrendion. Vilgrim tries to check for tracks, but there is a lot of water in this area, so he can't see any footprints. There are some reeds that have been disturbed, as though something or some things have passed through here, and fairly recently.
Brande suggests that maybe the Red Hand are sending someone to fight the tribe.
We all roll perception checks again. Ganraz rolls a 28, and Aleya was the lowest with 15. Everybody notices that there's this crack ahead of us. Movement through the vegetation, 120ft ahead. Ganraz picks up on a glint of metal to his left. A volley of arrows fly forwards.

{[h]We rollin initiative again bois}
{[b]Initiative order:} Brande, Jhen, Vilgrim, Aleya, Ganraz, Angelo
{[b]Surprise round} – only Ganraz gets to move. He sees a small creature wearing black and dark green armour, with leaf pauldrons, blended into the foliage. He fires an arrow at Ganraz, and Ganraz can see the arrow has something dripping from it. It pings off his armour.
Arrows fly at all of the group from various directions. One grazes Angelo's shoulder, and he takes 7 damage, but he rolls a 20 on his con save. He tries to see where the arrow came from, but can't make it out.
Jhen takes 7 damage, and 3 points of acid damage. Jhen also can't perceive where the arrow came from.
Brande takes 9 piercing damage, but no acid damage. He can make out where the arrow came from, rolling 17 on his perception. One of the creatures was leaning back against the tree, and he can see it now moving further up the tree.
Vilgrim takes 7 piercing damage, and just succeeds his con save. He also makes a perception check, but can't tell where the arrow came from.
Aleya takes 9 piercing damage, and 6 acid damage. She also can't perceive where the arrow came from.
Slamming through the undergrowth are two large creatures, which we recognise to be ogres. Their faces are painted with green and black, and both carry what appear to be nets around one arm, and javelins across their backs. The blue one draws the javelin from his back and throws it towards Jhen. He takes 12 piercing damage, but succeeds his dex save. It thuds into the ground beside him, sinking into the mud. The red ogre charges forwards towards the group.
Ganraz is next in the surprise round. His first attack misses, but his second hits [15 hits these ogres, good to know]. He tries his new trip attack, but the ogre saves on his strength. Ganraz deals 15 damage total. He action surges; his first attack hits, trying another trip attack, and his second misses.
{[b]Surprise round end}
Brande is up. He saw the one that shot at him, so he calls out to Ganraz, telling him to keep the big ones busy. He uses Hunter's Mark on the red archer, and then attacks him, using Sharpshooter. 9 doesn't hit. The red archer notches another arrow.
Jhen is next. He takes 6 acid damage at the start of his turn. He's looking a bit hurt. His arms swell, claws appear on his hands, his teeth elongate, and he gains 7 temporary hit points. He makes a claw attack against red ogre, dealing 13 damage.
DM: Next up, the Lurkers
Angelo and Brande: Oh hey, that thing we were talking about. Great.
Purple archer takes a shot at Angelo, who takes 9 points of damage, and succeeds his con save. Another arrow flies in towards Ganraz, who takes 9 piercing and 2 acid damage. The pink archer who fired tries to bonus action hide, but it's not the best. Another arrow flies at Angelo, shot by green archer, and the bard takes 12 damage. [It occurs to me at this moment, that Zac said Lurkers, which means they know who we are. Which is why they're targeting Angelo. Ah fuck.] Red shot at Ganraz, but missed. Blue archer shoots at Jhen, missing him. [In this moment, Seamus' player appears, so Aleya is swapped out for Seamus for balance's sake] Orange archer appears out of nowhere, shooting at Brande and misses. Orange archer then scrambles up a tree, apparently without difficulty; Brande can see that there are metal spikes on the ends of his fingers.
Vilgrim is next, and he does something he's never done before; he aims. He fires at green archer, dealing 20 damage. The green archer drops the arrow he was holding, and he looks very hurt.
Seamus deploys his arm barrier, giving him 10 temporary hit points. He then moves forwards, and charges his axe with lightning energy.
Red ogre takes a big swing at Ganraz, but Ganraz bats it away with his shield. There's a spray of mud as the club hits the ground. Blue ogre steps forwards and throws his second javelin at Seamus. It misses easily.
Ganraz takes 3 acid damage. He then dips his hand into his pocket, pulls out his potion of greater healing, and tosses it to Jhen. Jhen catches it easily, and gives Ganraz a slight nod. He then swings at the red ogre, dealing 17 damage, and then attacks again but rolls his third natural 1. He doesn't want to play dungeons and dragons anymore.
Angelo glares at the red ogre, and snarls, "Stay the fuck away from me" in Elvish. He deals 7 psychic damage. Somehow red boi is still alive, but he's looking very rough and he's very scared now. He then backs up, giving himself 7 hp back with Healing Word.
Brande steps forwards, shooting two scorching rays at the red ogre. The first misses, but the second hits, and he deals 5 damage, and it's enough to finish him off. His third ray fires at the green archer, and deals 6 fire damage. It is also enough to kill off that goblin.
Jhen is next. He's looking a bit rough, so he uses bonus action sip. He regains 20 hp. He then attacks the blue ogre, dealing 13 damage. The blue ogre doesn't look best pleased by that.
Purple Lurker fires at Angelo but misses. An arrow fires at Seamus, and breaks his arm barrier with 10 damage. Red archer fires at Brande, dealing 10 damage, and he's now poisoned. Blue shoots at Jhen, which deals 10 piercing damage and 3 acid damage. Orange boi shoots at Vilgrim, dealing 7 piercing and 5 acid damage.
Vilgrim takes another 8 acid damage instantly because it's the start of his round. He sees orange archer, and aims before he fires. He deals 20 damage. Orange archer looks really hurt, and definitely seems less smug than before.
Seamus attacks the blue ogre, dealing 11 damage, and then attacks again. 12 hits, holy shit, so the second attack deals 9 damage. The blue ogre seems to be readying a net.
It's his turn next. He tries to use his net on Ganraz and Jhen. There's large weights on either side of it; Ganraz rolls a 2, so he's definitely caught, and Jhen gets 13 total and is also caught. They are grappled, restrained and pulled towards the blue ogre.
Ganraz is literally in a net. He slashes at it, dealing 11 damage to the net. The DM informs him that he'd have to do that again to get out, so Ganraz does it again. He deals 12 damage, cutting a large enough hole to escape. With his bonus action, he attempts to shove the ogre. The DM rolls a natural 20.
Angelo knows that ogres are dumb. He casts Phantasmal Force on the remaining ogre; in the ogre's mind, a hellhound bursts out of the marsh, snapping and snarling and dealing 6 psychic damage. It tries to fend off this thing no-one else can see. The ogre drops the net. Angelo then yells (in Common, not Elvish, don't worry Brande), to Brande and tells him to take out the archers. Bardic inspiration.
Brande fires at one of the archers, dealing 24 damage. They're still up.
Jhen attacks the ogre, dealing 11 points of damage.
Goblins are up. Only Ganraz understands blue goblin's shout from the reeds; "Take down the red one and the spellcaster." Pink goblin runs from behind his tree, taking a shot at Seamus and dealing 12 damage, and 6 acid. Purple goblin jumps down, landing next to Angelo, and draws two daggers. Angelo dodges backwards. The goblin tries to dash away, and Angelo deals 7 damage with his sword as he flees. Orange archer tries to shoot Vilgrim, who uses uncanny dodge, taking 7 damage. Orange goblin then drops down and runs into the reeds. Red boi shoots at Brande, but misses. He's badly hurt, so he's not taking any risks, and climbs down carefully.
Vilgrim eyeballs orange boi. He kneels, aims, and rolls a nat 20. Orange goblin only had 6hp left but today he's getting the overkill treatment. 38 damage obliterates him.
Seamus lays into the ogre. His attack deals 18 damage. Second deals 14 damage.
The ogre is still swinging at the illusion, and takes another 3 psychic damage.
Ganraz slashes at the ogre, dealing 10 damage. He gets the How Do You Want To Do This. Ganraz goes for a horizontal disembowel. The blade sinks into flesh, guts spilling out, and mist rises from the intestines. He has another attack, so he charges after red goblin. Red goblin is notching another arrow, and turns to find Ganraz storming after him. He deals 11 damage, decapitating him instantly. He then turns to look at pink goblin and, in goblin says, "Time to run."
Angelo steps forwards, and tries to cast Hold Person on purple goblin. He saves bang on with a 15, so Angelo steps away, frustrated, and shouts at Brande to catch one of these fucking goblins. Bardic inspiration.
Brande, hearing this, hexes the purple boi and charges him. Purple boi fails his strength check, so Brande has him grappled.
Jhen is also pissed. He shoots at blue goblin, but just misses. He also moves up to where the goblins are running.
Vilgrim forgets about drinking a potion for now, and takes aim at the blue goblin as well. He deals 16 damage. Blue goblin hisses in pain, and Vilgrim allows himself a satisfied smirk.
Seamus steps forwards, and two bands of iron extend from his arms, attempting to grapple the blue goblin. He succeeds, and begins to reel it in. As he does so, he uppercuts the blue goblin, dealing 18 damage. The goblin is just split in half.
Pink boi tries to shoot at Ganraz, but it glances off his armour. The goblin tries to run, but Ganraz is charging after him. He deals 9 damage, and then 13 damage. Pink goblin is still alive, but he's terrified as Ganraz slams him to the ground with his shield.
Angelo holds out a hand towards purple goblin, and imposes his will upon him. His Hold Person is successful, and purple goblin freezes. He then tells Brande "I have him. You can let go if you want."
Brande does let go of the goblin, and begins to tie a rope around him.
Jhen takes a shot at pink goblin but misses.
Vilgrim helps Brande tie up the purple boi.
Seamus passes his turn.
Ganraz puts a foot on pink goblin's chest when he tries to get up, and drops his shield, grabbing his sword hilt with both hands and slamming it down into the pink goblin's forehead. It deals 9 damage.

And with that combat over, and a goblin captive, we end our session. `

`[Sweet bean Brande is played by Nick this session]
[Emily has made a surprise appearance as a guest character for this session; Sheyla]

{[h]We got a goblin}
[It's still 15 Eyre]
The party have just about recovered from the recent ambush. We have about 20 seconds left on Angelo's Hold Person spell. Ganraz goes to investigate the rest of the bodies. Vilgrim and Brande tie up the goblin firmly to make sure he can't run away. His hood has fallen back, and he's got leaves and dirt in his hair too.
Ganraz rolls his investigation check. He finds 3 green-tipped arrows, 10 normal arrows and 2 gold-headed arrows, with runes on the arrow head (on the lead goblin). In total there are 10 green-tipped arrows, and the ogres just have the large javelins, their clubs and these nets. None of them have any money on them. Aleya and Gareth rejoin the rest of us. Aleya takes 16 damage (carry over from last session).
Ganraz returns from looting to focus more on the captured goblin. Aleya rolls to see if she can make out any insignia, but can't. She does however know of the Lurkers, so she has a good idea of who these goblins are.
Aleya checks in with Vilgrim, seeing that he looks the worst out of all of us (he's got 5hp). She asks if he wants help, and offers to give him bandages.
Ganraz removes the goblin's mask. He's got a deep scar in his top lip, and there's some blood in the corner of his mouth. He asks if the goblin speaks Common, and when he says he does then we will let the goblin go. He rolls a 24 on persuasion.
The goblin says that he will not return to Saarvith. Ganraz asks what Saarvith is doing in this area.
[The following information is all a bit scrappy and disorganised because I was typing very quickly, but the highlights are all in there, it's just a mess]
 The goblin tells us that they're here to watch the brood. There is also someone called the Mind Bender [the whole party have a big HHMMMMM moment]. Some of the early brood have wandered, and these Lurkers were sent to gather them up and take them back to Rhest [he calls it the Sunken City]. The Mind Bender is apparently sent by Ulwai(?), who is apparently called Stormcaller, another of the Wyrmlords. Nurkel'nak is a spooky hobgoblin. Aleya asks what the brood is. They are apparently razor fiends, a gift from the Dragon Queen. She also asks if this group of Lurkers are the only ones keeping tabs on the wolfmen. He says no. Angelo and Aleya both roll insight checks. Angelo can tell that he's not lying, but he's not telling the whole truth. The goblin says that there are about 60 Lurkers. Aleya asks out of personal curiosity why the Lurkers would join the Red Hand. The Lurkers are opportunists. Saarvith replaced Broken Tooth (the former leader of the Lurkers) about 5 – 6 years ago, and at that time that Darguun was becoming more dangerous. The last time the Lurkers were with the horde was about 4 months ago. When he was last with the horde, he counted it as 4500 hobgoblins, 1600 goblins (including the Lurkers and some bugbears). The Lurkers believe The Dragon Queen is a powerful ally, but don't really believe she's divine.
Angelo asks if Saarvith has a dragon with him; he apparently has Regiarix the black dragon with him. The dragon is apparently hanging out in Rhest, watching the brood. Kharn leads a host of 7000 hobgoblins. All of his forces are trained and battle hardened. Ulwai has bolstered the ranks of her mind benders, war priests and monks. The Lurker says that they have all been in the mountains for 3 or so years, building this army together.
Ganraz clarifies how many Wyrmlords there are. Koth is supposedly the newest. The goblin is amused when Ganraz tells him that Koth is also very dead; the Lurker is pleased that he was captured by capable people, otherwise he would have been embarrassed. Ulwai is somewhere, and also magically inclined but more zealous. Saarvith, who runs the Lurkers and is hanging out with a black dragon. Kharn is someone who Aleya and Ganraz would have heard of. He is apparently terrifying and awe inspiring. His men are devoted to him. Then there is Azarr Kul, a hobgoblin with blue-scaled skin. He is rarely seen, and communicates through his underlings.
The goblin says that he will head west if he's allowed to go, and will not return to the horde.
Vilgrim asks about the green-tipped arrows, and it turns out they're called Flesh Eaters, with magically enhanced acidic properties. Angelo asks if that's a Lurker thing, and it seems to be their specialty. Vilgrim also pats down the goblin as Ganraz preps to cut his bonds. Aleya messages Angelo, asking if he's got any charges left on his wand. He tells her he does and asks why. She says that we can't let this goblin get away.
As Ganraz cuts the ropes, we hear a low horn blast over the moors. Jhen recognises it as a call for aid from one of his people. He says we must answer, and runs to help. Ganraz and Brande charge after him too, with Vilgrim following, but Angelo hesitates because he was talking to Aleya. Aleya turns, and casts Magic Missile before Angelo has a chance to react to what's happening. The goblin running away is obliterated by 20 damage and is definitely dead. That solves the sudden moral dilemma for Angelo.
We all charge after Jhen.

{[h]On the move}
We are charging over the muddy, swampy landscape, and as we break through the bracken we see…
A hill rises out of the bog and ends with woodland. There's some felled trees and dead trees scattered around, and the setting sun behind us casts shadows. There appears to be the corpse of a giant owl, and even from this distance we can make out horrifically large gashes in its side. We're about 100ft back from all of this, but we are moving closer.
Suddenly, a figure in dark iron armour jumps from the canopy of one of the nearby trees and lands, skidding to a halt. She is 6ft tall, with black hair tied into a Viking braid ponytail. Jhen makes it to the bottom of the hill before all of us. Following her is a large reptilian creature, with sickly green scales. Quadripedal, but its front legs have wing flaps, and each limb ends in 3 talons. [I have a vague image in my head of a green flying squirrel, which I share with the group]

{[h]Roll for initiative}
{[b]Initiative order:} Jhen, Vilgrim, Sheyla, Brande, Angelo, Aleya, Razor Fiend 1, Ganraz, Razor Fiend 2

Jhen doesn't have a shot at the creature yet. So he uses his movement to crest the ridge. Emily's character sees her brother appear. Jhen notches an arrow, but it breaks against the creature's hide and does no damage.
Vilgrim runs forwards, tucking in behind a ridge to give himself cover. He slams against it, taking a moment to catch his breath. He uses his action to drink his potion of greater healing, giving himself 20 hp back.
Up next is Emily's character, Sheyla. She uses her action to scramble up the tree closest to her.
Brande is next. He moves forwards so that he can still see the creature. He uses his Hunter's Mark on it, and attempts to Sharpshooter shot it. 14 doesn't hit.
Angelo runs forwards, using his action to dash, and then stops near Brande. He shouts up to Jhen, "Be careful!" and bardic inspires him.
Aleya does the same, charging forwards, and uses her Second Wind to give herself some health back.
The razor fiend travels forwards, making a bite attack against Sheyla. She takes 9 piercing and 9 poison damage. She fails her saving throw, and is knocked out of the tree. It doesn't fly, it glides [Vilgrim and Angelo's players: It's like a flying squirrel]
Ganraz charges forwards, reaching Jhen's side. From her position on the ground, Sheyla can see both of them now but not the rest of the party.
A second creature leaps out of the trees, and breathes a cloud of green gas. [Ganraz's player: Cone me daddy]. Jhen takes 31 poison damage, and Ganraz takes 16. Jhen is on 1hp.
Jhen is next. Oh no. Oh yikes. He repositions, a wise strategy, and takes a shot at razord fiend 1. 16 hits. It takes 10 points of piercing damage.
Vilgrim turns the corner slightly, shooting at razor fiend 1. He deals 24 damage. The arrows sinks in and then falls out, but the flesh on the creature begins to melt.
Sheyla makes a tactical assessment and decides she is in immediate danger. She stands, shooting at razor fiend 1 and deals 2 damage.
Brande shifts away from the poison cloud. He casts hex on razor fiend 1, and then shoots, dealing 20 damage.
Angelo runs forwards, and gives Ganraz 7hp back. He then uses his wand of Magic Missiles, dealing 9 damage to razor fiend 1. It's looking pretty hurt.
Aleya charges forwards to stand beside Ganraz, igniting her sword, and fires another Magic Missile into razor fiend 1. She deals 9 damage total.
Razor fiend 1 doesn't get his breath weapon back. It takes 5 more acid damage, and it's looking pretty fucked. It jumps down from the tree, and moves over to Aleya. Its first attack misses, as does its second. It tries for a bite attack, and she takes 12 piercing damage.
Ganraz moves around to stay near both of the razor fiends. He uses this opportunity to command Vilgrim, who uses his reaction to… roll a nat 1. So, cool. Ganraz takes another swing at the first razor fiend. He uses his bonus to shove the creature. Strength contest – they both roll 20 first, and then Ganraz succeeds on the second try. It is now prone.
Razor fiend 2 also doesn't get its breath weapon back. It decides to unload on Ganraz. Its first attack misses, but its second is 26. Ganraz takes 9 piercing damage. The third attack doesn't hit.
Jhen takes another shot at the first razor fiend. He deals 13 piercing damage, plus 6. Jhen gets the How Do You Want To Do This, fuck yes.
Vilgrim leans out to assess the situation. He shoots at razor fiend 2… and rolls a nat 20, dealing a total of 42 damage. Acid begins to eat away at it. Goddamn.
Sheyla can see that razor fiend is looking pretty bad, so she shifts into her more lupine appearance, similar to what we've seen Jhen do. Her first attack misses, but her second attack is a nat 20. She pumps a second level divine smite, dealing a total of 21 slashing damage and 26 divine smite damage.
Brande moves forwards. He transfers his hex to the second razor fiend, and deals 15 damage. Just as the razor fiend is about to bite down on Ganraz, a heat-haze arrow sinks into the roof of its mouth, the necrotic damage making its head collapse.
Vilgrim reminds the DM that the razor fiend takes another 6 acid damage as it dies.

{[h]We actually survived that}
Brande needs to have a sit down, he's poisoned and exhausted. Jhen slowly staggers back over to us. Sheyla doesn't really care about any of us, instead focusing on the body beneath the dead owl. He appears to be unconscious. Angelo casts Healing Word on Jhen, giving him 8hp back. Brande also gives him 8hp back with Cure Wounds.
Jhen nods to both of us, acknowledging our help. He then addresses Sheyla, asking her if she's ok. She says she's fine, and asks why he's here. He confirms that she's aware of the stuff that's happening in the sunken city, and then rolls a nat 1 on his medicine check on Tarrick(?).
Aleya and Angelo roll 21 on their perception checks bUT GANRAZ ROLLS 22, GET FUCKD. We can make out the silhouettes of four more winged creatures making their way towards us.
Angelo and Aleya: We need to leave.
Ganraz: Finna bool
Sheyla tells us that we don't need to leave, as they are her friends. Now that we're all closer, we can tell that the armour of Sheyla and Tarrick is made of dark wood, with green accents because of the vines.
Aleya asks how Sheyla knows Jhen, and she says he is her brother, who she hasn't seen for 15 years. She sounds a bit bitter. Oops. Jhen introduces her to us, and greets her by making a sign against his shoulder left shoulder with his right hand.
Ganraz checks out the giant owl, and can see that it would have been a beautiful creature. It's suffered very deep lacerations, along its neck and one side. It looks to Ganraz like Sheyla's friend took mostly fall damage.
Sheyla steps forwards and uses Lay on Hands to give him 10hp back. A thin layer of moss temporarily covers his wounds, and then fades away. He's breathing, but not awake.
Aleya checks out one of the razor fiend, and removes a couple of scales. She then checks in its mouth, and looks to see if there's any poison delivery systems within. She rolls an 18 medicine check, and she can see there's grooves on the back of the canines, which seem to be dripping a constant stream of poison, and it seems to mingle with the saliva. She takes a bit of time to harvest some, which she'll do for a while as a job.
As this is happening, the four flying figures make it to us. Four giant owls land around us, and it's the best thing Vilgrim has ever seen. Two males, one female ride the owls. They're dressed in the same armour as Sheyla. The leader draws a beautiful long sword, which looks like a LoTR elvish blade.
He asks Sheyla who "these outsiders" are. She admits she doesn't know. He then notices Jhen, and is surprised to see him. Jhen makes the same salute he did earlier, but the guy doesn't return it. He introduces himself as Killiar, who asks Ganraz what our business is. Ganraz briefly explains that we have a common enemy, and Killiar agrees. He asks the rest of us if we're travelling with Jhen, which we say we are. Killiar says that he will take us back to the Longclaw home, and we'll fly on the owls to get there. He assigns us owls, and most of us fly in pairs.
As we soar over the canopy of the trees, Vilgrim is living a dream right now. Brande is terrified, clinging on for dear life. Ganraz is riding with Jhen, and can see that Jhen seems like a total natural at this. We swoop over the expanse of forest, and we see the land rising slightly, surrounded by much larger trees. In the centre is a massive tree, probably 150ft. Buildings made of wood appear to be carved into this tree. To its left is an even bigger tree, probably 400ft, and we can see nothing through the canopy. It's very dark. There are a few trees of white around the area. There are quite a few tents on the ground, and tree houses built into the taller trees.

{[h]Starsong Hill}
We're deposited in a decent enough clearing, and the owls are led away. Vilgrim is sad to see them go. Killiar tells us that the Starsinger will want to talk to us, but says he knows that we'll want rest. Some more of the clan run up to help Sheyla take Tarrick to the water, where he'll apparently be healed. Killiar then turns his attention back to us. He'll arrange an audience with the Starsinger, and gives us a place to stay in the meantime, and then asks Jhen to follow him off somewhere else.
As Jhen leaves, Ganraz thanks him. We're lead through the town by these other shifters, and lots of people give us looks as we pass by. Not necessarily negative, we are just obviously outsiders. We pass two large wooden structures, and we're told this is the star market. As we pass through, Aleya can smell incense, so she knows she can probably get some here. There are a few children playing, but they seem to be sparring as well. We reach some 200ft tall trees, with domed treehouses built into the tree, with a lift system built in. We ascend into the treeline, and are lead into a two storied house, open plan. There are some stools with cushions, and a circular table. Tiered hammocks. Four on the bottom floor, six on the upper floor. It's kind of open to the elements, but there is a shutter we can pull across the big window.
The two men who accompanied us tell us that we should wait here to recover before we speak to the Starsinger.
We have a couple of hours to ourselves. Brande goes to have a lie down, as he's still poisoned. The sun has mostly gone down now, but there are lights in almost every tree, and campfires below.
Vilgrim is hyped af, and asks if we've ever seen anything quite so beautiful. Aleya and Angelo agree that it's beautiful, but Aleya isn't quite so comfortable with being this high up. Angelo asks if she's afraid of heights, and she says no, but with being this high up it makes sense to be cautious.
Angelo scribbles some notes in his black book.
Aleya and Angelo both want a bath, but of course ladies first. The guy who brings water tells us that Jhen has met with the Starsinger, and that Sheyla's friend is going to live. The Starsinger will be expecting us soon.
And this is where we end our session.

{[h]Starsong Hill}
[It's still Sul 15 Eyre, just at night]
We're all still in the guest lodge offered to us by Jhen's clan, and we have about an hour before our meeting with the Starsinger.
The lodge is circular and two-storied, and built against the tree. We're about 150ft off the ground. One wall is open to the elements, but there's a wooden shutter of sorts that can be pulled across if we want. Lights begin to appear in the trees throughout the canopy as the evening wears on. Brande is sleeping fitfully, as he's trying to nap off the poison. Ganraz is also napping in a hammock, as he's exhausted.
Aleya gets out of the bath and gets dressed. Angelo hops in for a brief wash.
When he wakes up, Ganraz takes Aleya aside, and says in a fairly plain voice, not intended as a threat per se; "I appreciate that you were acting in our best interests and I don't doubt that you were, but if I offer somebody their life in exchange for something and they meet their end of that bargain, they are under my protection until they leave my company - even if that means protecting them from allies and friends. I don't want us to be at odds over something like that, so I just want to make my position on it clear for any future encounters."
To which Aleya responds: "I get it, I really do, but honestly, our odds are bad enough without making them worse. This is no longer 'just another job'. Sorry for making that decision, but I don't feel we can take chances with shit like that. It may just be better to discuss it with the others before we decide either way, for better or for worse we are a group of sorts now."
The rest of the party don't overhear this, but we can see the two talking and can tell Ganraz isn't best pleased.
Shelya is with the druids.
Brande isn't having a good time; it's rare for him to feel heat, but the boy is sweating. A healer has been sent for to alleviate his pain before. As he clutches at the hammock, he grips feathers. He opens his eyes, and finds he's riding alone atop one of the giant owls. Fear immediately makes his stomach clench. As he peeks over the side, past the wings, and although he can't see anything below he gets the sense that everything below is death. He tries to regain balance, and finds the feathers gone. Instead, there are green scales… and then he's falling. He breaks the cloud layer, and is rapidly approaching this expanse of rough, black volcanic rock. Then he hears a voice, "Don't fear… Tine Siorai's embers rise, and so shall you. Rise." He is still falling, and tries to summon his bow. The smoke begins to swirl, and is then whipped away in the wind. The voice comes again, "RISE."
The rest of the party feel a blast of hot air, and as we turn to look we see Brande's hammock is a smouldering on the ground. A heat haze surrounds him, and wings made of fire have unfurled from his back. He's floating 5ft off the ground, and is still asleep. The group are filled with a mixture of horror and awe. Then logic kicks in, and Aleya shouts to Vilgrim to grab water from the bath. Angelo jumps out as Vilgrim scoops a bucket. Brande eventually snaps out of it, coming to just as he's about to hit the ceiling. He fails an acrobatics check and lands on his face. Vilgrim tosses the bucket of water over him, and the water sizzles off.
As one, everyone is just like "what the fuck, Brande." He's also not poisoned anymore, so that's a thing.
At this moment, the healer arrives and sees the scorch marks on the floor. She asks if there's anyone who needs help with poison. Vilgrim says "It's fine, he's burned it off." Everyone slowly turns to look at him.
Aleya asks Angelo if he knows anything about using magic to manipulate dreams or something. He says that it is possible to influence someone's dreams and memories, but he thinks that was a bit excessive, and that it would probably take someone powerful to do it. He also points out that he's glad that it didn't happen whilst we were camping in the dome. Seamus remarks that Brande is still full of surprises.
Brande is pretty shaken up, and needs some time to think it over.
Sheyla arrives, still dressed in her armour. She sees we're all seated, chilling on cushions on the floor or sitting on the hammock. She can also see there are some scorch marks on the ceiling. She asks about them, and Angelo tells her we had some sort of accident. Brande admits his powers were a little more chaotic than usual and apologises.
She asks us how we know Jhen. Vilgrim and Brande tell her about Jhen being part of the caravan, and how he's incredibly helpful. Ganraz, as the one who's known Jhen the longest, commends Jhen's ability as one of Markos' men. Sheyla says she wouldn't know the man her brother has become, so she is glad to hear he is on the side of good. She also thanks us for saving her life and that of her mate, Tarrick. Vilgrim says that we are all on the same side, after all. Sheyla wants to know if we're hunting the Harrow Beasts (Razor Fiends) too. We say we are, and hunting the one who's breeding them. This is news to Sheyla, who didn't know they were being bred. Vilgrim fills her in on the session notes from last time, and Sheyla thinks she might have an idea of where they might be.
Vilgrim asks how long the clan have been having problems with the issues around the sunken city. They've been dealing with goblins for 3 or 4 months, but the razor fiends have been in the last few months. He then asks her what the general plans are from the clan, whether they're just trying to do damage control and maintain the marshland around their home, or if they're trying to strike back.
The clan can't afford a full-on assault.
Ganraz introduces himself properly to Sheyla. He introduces each of the party members in turn. Angelo is drying his hair after his bath, with Brande's help (B: Are you sure you trust me now? A: It's fine, I have counterspell). We all offer various greetings, and Ganraz does a quick campaign recap for Sheyla's benefit. She hasn't heard of this Tiamat thing before, but she had heard rumours from Longclaw scouts about the army moving nearby. The size of the force alarms her though.
As we're following Sheyla to go and see the Starsinger, Vilgrim is visibly hyped about being here. He asks Ganraz if he can introduce the party instead of him, because he'd like to thank them for the opportunity to see all of this natural splendour. Ganraz says that Jhen told him that the clan prefer the individual to speak for themselves.
Vilgrim then turns his sneaky boi black stealth cloak inside out to show the other side, which is green. Living his best accessory life. Angelo considers taking out his glamourweave side cape, but decides against it, as it might be a bit extra. Aleya chooses to wear less armour, as she won't need it for this.

{[h]Meeting Starsinger Sellyr}
Everything around us is lit by the firefly lamps. Aleya looks out of the sea of glittering lights in the trees and smiles a little. Shelya steps off of the lift we're using without breaking stride, and we follow her past the Star Market, which is closed for the night. It's about 10pm now.
The Ancestor Tree is a giant cyprus tree, 450ft tall. That's a fucking big tree. There are buildings made of white wood and green glass stretching all the way up into the canopy. There is a bridge connecting this to another tree, which is about 500ft tall, and when we look up we just see darkness above. Like staring into the void. The Shadow Bark Tree is incredibly imposing. Steps spiral all the way around the Ancestor Tree, and there are also some lifts.
Vilgrim is asked to roll a d20. He rolls a 4. The DM says "Good to know".
As Angelo's walking along, he notices off to the left that at the base of the Shadow Bark Tree, there are temple-like structures. There is a very large tent with totems around it, and just past it there are shimmering waters, almost bioluminescent. It's illuminating a normal-sized willow tree, which is bone white.
As we begin to ascend the staircase, Sheyla seems to have no trouble. Some are doing better than others on the climb; Vilgrim's power to weight ratio is pretty decent. Angelo's spent too long as a pretty little lordling and is slightly regretting not working on his cardio more.
We reach a circular chamber with tiered seating around a central area. There are star motifs carved into the ceiling. Doing a quick scan around the room, we can see there's about 30 shifters in the room sitting around. Jhen is standing slightly off the side. It looks like there's room for a few hundred to cram into here. We can see Killiar, head of the Talons of Arawai, sitting nearby, as well as the two hunters we met before. The door is set in place behind us so that nobody else can ascend up after us and interrupt the meeting. Sheyla can obviously recognise all of the Talon members.
Sitting cross-legged watching us is Sellyr. She wears a wooden circlet with a sapphire set in the centre. Her hair is a long, elegant braid of silver, and her eyes are completely blue – no pupil, no iris, just blue. Slowly orbiting around her head is an incandescent blue sphere. Laying curled around her is one of the huge crocodiles we've encountered before, and she's just gently stroking its head.
Looking at the stone, something jog's Angelo's memory. He is proficient in history, and even with disadvantage he rolls a 21. He can't remember exactly what they're called, but knows they're wondrous in nature.
Sellyr sits up a little straighter as we enter, and it's obvious all eyes are on us. She makes the same salute/gesture that we've seen Jhen make before. She greets us, and asks if we know we're being watched. We ask if she's referring to the people in the room, and she takes that an answer. She stands, and looks at something over Vilgrim's shoulder, and says, "Leave." Casts Dispel Magic.
Well fuck.
She then sits and asks us to begin. She tells us that Jhen has informed us of our purpose, and that we should all speak for ourselves. Vilgrim, still a little shaken by our recent revelation, steps forwards. He gives them a nice theatrical bow, and begins. "We are honoured by the hospitality you have shown us." Sellyr says it's not often that outsiders venture this far into the marsh. He also praises the beauty of Starsong Hill, and the creatures that the clan inhabit it with. He notices that slightly to the right is a figure wearing a cloak made of feathers. He looks towards Vilgrim and makes the salute/gesture. Sellyr gestures to Jarl, the figure who stood up, and says that she's sure he appreciates the compliment, as he's the one who looks after the Great Nests.
Vilgrim goes on to tell her part of his version of the story. Travelling with the refugees, seeking a new home after The Mourning. By complete chance, we stumbled upon some hobgoblin scouts, which we found out later were part of a much larger force. He asks if she's heard of them as the Red Hand, and she says that yes, they've seen the emblem before. He also recounts our discovery of the plans we found in Vraath Keep, and what some of the documents entailed. That's why we've travelled here, and explains how we've begun to form some sort of resistance, and how we've begun to slow the Red Hand's progress to help not just the refugees but also the rest of the inhabitants of the Vale. He informs her that one of the Red Hand's leaders has been breeding creatures in the city of Rhest, which is ultimately why we have come in this direction.
She asks if we seek their aid in a war. Vilgrim says that we don't expect any aid in a full on war, but that the party is going to try and disrupt their efforts, and if they could lend aid in our endeavour we would be incredibly grateful. He does understand that we are taking a great risk, and he doesn't expect anything from the clan. What they've given us already is very welcome.
She finds Vilgrim very interesting; he's more restrained than Jhen, but then maybe their people are more open and straightforward. Jhen directly asked for aid, but Vilgrim didn't. Sellyr says that they don't necessarily have the means to assist in fighting larger battles. She is bothered by the goblins however, and the creatures disturb her. Killiar chips in, telling us that they've had ever more violent encounters with the Red Hand, and have lost scouts and had some owl injured. Many of his order, the Talons, are currently occupied hunting the Harrow Beasts/Razor Fiends. The Starsinger has been clear with Jhen that the clan is currently not in any position to give aid. However, if we are to head to the sunken city and remove what is there, they might be in a better place to help us.
Vilgrim offers a little persuasion. He believes the Red Hand may have deemed the clan a threat. He ask the party whether we can show the clan the letters we found. Ganraz has the letters, whilst Aleya has the translations. Sellyr says that the clan don't have overwhelming numbers, and Vilgrim agrees that the party isn't exactly the largest force either, and that we intend to move fast and hit hard rather than enter prolonged combat. Yarl chimes in by telling us that the clan have 10 owls that are currently unoccupied and fit for travel. Sellyr says that she doesn't want the owls to get peppered with arrows. Also, the people of the Vale have forgotten the clan, with the exception of the few small towns that still trade with them. The Longclaws have been the most active in maintaining their land. She then turns to Killiar, and asks what he's willing to do, as everyone in Starsong Hill makes their own choices. She's not in charge, people just listen to her.
Killiar says he's willing to guide us to the sunken city, but won't get too close because they know of the creature that dwells there. He has lost two owls to the large black-scaled creature. Vilgrim asks about the behaviour of the creature, and is told that it is usually guarding the area. The lizard folk nearby have begun worshipping it, so it no longer has to travel and hunt. Sheyla says she will accompany further than the border of Rhest, as we helped her, so she will help us.
Sellyr turns towards Sheyla, and says that she still has a boisterous streak like Jhen. Sheyla admits this, and says that her brother has spread his wings, this is her doing the same.
Sellyr tells us to seek out Ota to ask for help if we need to traverse the waters of Rhest. We have a day to rest in Starsong Hill, as it's best to travel through the cover of night.
NPCS we've learned of: Killiar the Skywarden. Lanik is technically second in command. Mala. Tarrick. Ota is the lead druid at the Water of Arawai. Yarl.
As she's leaving, Vilgrim asks the Starsinger what she saw behind him. She tells him that someone was watching us from afar. Vilgrim asks if she knows who, but she doesn't. We're asked if we know of such magic. Angelo is the only one who does recognise that style of magic; he's taken great pains before the make sure he's never watched through scrying, and is careful to avoid casters powerful enough to cast it, and makes sure he doesn't leave any objects behind that he can be tracked with. He doesn't share this knowledge though. Vilgrim is deep in thought.
With his new ability, Ganraz can tell that Sellyr, Killiar and Mala are all more dangerous than we are.
Aleya makes sure to put her silver wire around the beds before she goes to bed, and as per usual she excludes Vilgrim from that, so he can trigger it but the rest of the party can't. Angelo takes the time to get into comfy pjs before he goes to bed, because fuck it why not.
[The party has a quick break. Turns out that every time Vilgrim has been rolling a d20, it's been to determine whether someone's been scrying on the party]
Vilgrim does trigger the alarm, which wakes up Aleya. She waits 30 seconds, and then summons her sword to her hand and follows him. She rolls an 18, and his passive perception is 14, so he doesn't notice her. He walks a fair distance away from the party, heading down one of the ladders. He looks around to make sure he's alone, and he thinks it's clear, and then pulls out his stone. [The party help out with counting by doing group jazz hands] "I noticed surveillance. I thought we'd agreed I would do this my way. Truthfully, was this the Trust's action? Also, no word about aid?"
A reply "Our surveillance is limited to our agents. You are one of them. Our eyes are not upon you. Resources are being utilised as we see fit."
The area around Vilgrim begins to glow. Aleya steps forwards, sword in hand. "Hey Vilgrim." He reaches for his sword hilt. Oh fuck. Oh shit. His odds of surviving this encounter are decreasing.
He asks her to let him explain. [No, Vilgrim, she kills people after they explain]. She says he should talk quickly. He explains slowly that he's been working for the Trust – she hasn't heard of them, and asks him to clarify. He admits that he's being watched, and his actions are being monitored, so if he tells her too much then he will be in just as much danger as she is putting him in right now. He hopes she understands that the reason he's not been forthcoming is because not because he wishes anyone any harm, but because of risk to himself. He tells her that the Trust is an organisation that not many people know about, and they gather information. He is just one of those who do so. At first, he was just supposed to monitor the state of the refugees, but recent events have changed his plans somewhat. He admits to reporting information on what the party have been doing. Aleya can tell that he's a shifty gnomey little fella [DM's words, not mine], but he doesn't seem to be lying to her face.
She asks if he makes these reports daily. He says no, he just does it when there's opportunity to. He says that the gnomes value information. She asks what they want. He says they want things to remain in the state that they are. They want peace and order, specifically order. She tries to insight check him again, but only gets 5. He believes that if the Trust were to know the full extent of the situation with the Red Hand.
Aleya says that she will not tell the others he's part of the Trust. He says it's probably not worth trying to keep up pretences. She says that one or two of the party members may have already guessed he's up to something [cough Angelo cough]. He believes that this party will be held together by the trust that the party members have for each other.
She asks him for a favour. She wants him to ask the Trust about a gnome called Etri. He says he'll see what he can do. She thinks he's dead, but would like to find out the truth. Vilgrim says that there are quite a few gnomes that have that name, so she might need something more specific. She says he has dark hair and a similar skillset to Vilgrim's. She worked with him on a job during the war. Ganraz was there too, and some others. It involved infiltrating a castle of a high ranking official, called Kastavryl Novrern. Vilgrim warns her that they work for a price, and he cannot guarantee he'll find anything.
He tentatively holds out a hand. "Will you accept my apology?" She tells him flat that she doesn't trust him, but it's good to know where he stands. And it's useful to know who he's working for.
Aleya deactivates her blade, and the two of them return to bed.

{[h]Mol 16 Eyre}
We wake up in the morning, officially level 7.
Aleya goes down to the market. She's looking for charcoal, herbs, some darker clothes. She was thinking about getting some paint too for dulling her armour. Brande also goes down to the market, grabbing some kindling. Gareth spends some time talking to a forest gnome named Lian(?) and gets fucked up on berry wine, made of assassin vine berries.
Once she has this, she returns to the guest lodge. Angelo is there when she gets back, and notices her drawing out a symbol on the floor. In the centre, appears a small, pale grey hawk. In the middle of its chest is a crescent symbol, identical to the symbol on her bracers.
Angelo regrettably changes out of his blue tunic and into a black tunic (with the same silver trim design, so not uber stealthy). Sheyla and Aleya are both geared up in full combat with stealth paint, and judge him slightly for his wardrobe choice. He notices them judging him, and compliments their appearance, telling them both they look stunning. He also points out that this is the best that he can do, for someone who's not geared for stealth. He can also turn invisible, which compensates. He then jokingly asks Aleya to rate his look out of ten. She says that we're heading into a dragon infested city. Angelo tells her that's not what he asked.
We eventually make our way to the Waters of Arawai, where Angelo notices bright white orchids growing around the white willow tree. The Scribe gets hyped as fuck. The waters look beautiful. As we enter the large tent, an old wizened female tortle turns around to greet us. "A noble, two warriors, one of the fire-touched, a human whose eyes have seen much, and a gnome of the Zil. Strange visitors for Ota today. Come in." She tells us that Sellyr has already informed her that we will need her assistance.
Sheyla tells her that the outsiders need help getting into Rhest, and asks if she has "anything in the turtle shack." Ota scolds her, telling her it's not a shack. She rummages through a chest, chucking miscellaneous bits over her shoulder. Brande gets clocked by a small rabbit skull. Ota grabs a scroll, and offers it to the party. Aleya checks it, but it's a Scroll of Water Walking, and she doesn't understand it, so she hands it to Angelo.
We browse Ota's wares. Aleya buys two potions of Greater Healing, and gives one to Ganraz. Whilst others are debating prices for goodies, Ota gives Sheyla a bone pendant with a carving in it. It will stop her from being scryed upon. There is a second one for Vilgrim. [There is a 10ft radius around Vilgrim now which is scry free]. It's a gift from Sellyr herself. Vilgrim buys the last Greater Healing potion and one normal potion. He gives the normal potion to Angelo [cheapskate] and says after what happened last time, he wouldn't want any harm to come to him. Angelo accepts, even though he don't trust like that.
Aleya turns to Vilgrim and gives him the vial of green drake venom that she harvested earlier, and says that she trusts that he knows what to do with it. She also messages him, adding that if any of it ends up in the party's food, then her sword will go through his head. He tries to laugh it off but he looks pretty spooked.
Vilgrim tries to haggle for price on the arrows. She says she'll give him 4 arrows, if he can bring her back 4 fangs, a similar sample of venom, and as many talons as we can gather.
Angelo shows Ota the Staff of Orchids he has seen the willow tree outside. He asks if she knows anything about it. She takes it to examine it, and briefly begins to attune to it due to her druid power, just to determine what it is. She says it is ancient, older even than Ota herself, from a time when the people of Starsong Hill were still well known among the people of the Vale. She asks if it's a gift for Ota, but she's joking [new favourite NPC, sorry Jhen I still love you]. She then says more seriously that Angelo might seek to use the Waters of Arawai, but it's a sacred place and we are still strangers. Angelo bows, saying that he meant no offense. She scoffs, saying she's not offended. Also he probably shouldn't bow anymore, because even though she knows he's being respectful he will look weird doing that around the clan. She says that the Longclaws think outsiders are soft. Angelo smells faintly of lavender.
Ota is called to help the druids in the grove, so she totters off, wishing us well and telling us to go and kill Razor Fiends.
{[h]Taking flight}
We gather at the Great Nests as night falls.
Brande isn't looking forward to flying again after his recent dream. He rides with Angelo so that he's not alone. We glide almost soundlessly over the marshland and discover the broken dam near Rhest. We can see the Sunken City of Rhest; grand structures stretch up from water like shattered ribs, and we can make out some dryer areas.
The owls fly low and land about 500ft back from the water's edge. Aleya sends her hawk upwards, doing a quick perception check with it, but can't see any dragons. Sheyla also can't see any dragons.
Killiar says he's not willing to go any further, and we thank him for getting us this far. The northern part is more flooded by the broken dam, but we are at the south end of the city. Killiar tells us that there is a tribe of lizard folk that live on pontoons along the lake. The other Talon members that came with us are also not going any further. Killiar suggests that crossing the water is safer in this area, but we should be careful of the lizard tribes. Sheyla suggests that we just kill them all. Lanik smiles, hefting an axe, and says that's why he likes Sheyla.
The Talons remount, leaving us alone on the bank of the ruined city.

And that is where we end this session.`

`[The Scribe turns up an hour late with starbucks, to find the party still safe and sound and not in combat. Yet.]

{[h]Prep}
We decide to take out the bell tower across the lake, which has been used as an alarm before when the clan members tried to attack.
The lizard bois can't see in the dark, much like humans. So we move around the lake, and all roll stealth checks. Thanks to Jhen's Pass Without Trace, we all get +10. Those are some big boi stealth checks.
Aleya can see fuck all in this darkness, and she can't risk lighting her sword. Knowing this, and being one of the only members of the party who doesn't require two hands to use a weapon if we get ambushed, Angelo offers to guide her along the lake. He offers the choice of taking his hand or holding onto the back of his belt. She takes his hand.
We all roll perception checks with disadvantage, and Brande rolls highest. He can see flickering of lights across the lake, coming from the direction we just were. He points this out to the group. Jhen says that it's possible there's some kind of activity, but from this distance it's hard to tell. Brande asks if they have any traditions, because he obviously don't want to disrespect their culture. Sheyla says no. Gareth says it could just be torches.
We make it round to the east side of the lake, and can see that most of the ground floors are submerged. We roll another perception check, and Angelo and Ganraz can also now tell that there's torches in the distance. Ganraz inspects the bell tower more closely, and can tell it has a roof. He can see that there's an orange glow there. Seamus also rolls another perception check, but he can't see the bell from this distance.
Gareth gets a little closer to the water, and can tell it's murky af. It's bog water rather than lake water. He dunks his head under to have a look around, but the visibility is shit. He suggests that we should only go in the water if we're trying to avoid monsters. Vilgrim says that there could also be creatures at the bottom. Ganraz, as he's taking his armour off, gives him a look.
There's definitely a gathering of torchlight at the southern end of the lake. Brande rolls a high perception, and tries to point it out to Gareth, but he's still got lake water in his face and can't see anything. It doesn't seem like the lights are coming towards us, but there are a few of them. Brande then warns the party, and Ganraz says that the lizard bois might have noticed the owls and are converging on the point where we landed.
We decide to make our way across the lake quickly. It's crunch time bois.
It's been a long time since Angelo had to use a scroll as a focus; he's getting flashbacks of his tuition from when he was younger. He takes a second to read it, warns everyone else that this is a one-time cast and will only last an hour, and then uses the scroll to cast Water Walk. The sigils on the scroll burn away.

{[h]We stealthin bois}
We all roll pretty decent on our stealth, thanks to Jhen's Pass Without Trace. Party order: Ganraz, Gareth, Angelo and Aleya, Jhen, Vilgrim, Brande, Seamus
As we're creeping across the lake, we can see the lights gathering at the south end of the lake. They seem to be moving slowly towards the north. Where we are. There is cover about 50 metres away from us. We hear a long dull metallic sound, and can see silhouetted wings unfurling. The dragon lifts in the air, rising to about 100ft above us. It then lazily flies to the south, towards the lights.
Angelo and Ganraz roll another perception check, and can tell the lights are slow. It seems to be some sort of barge.
We all lie low and wait for the dragon to pass overhead. It doesn't seem to notice us, focused on the barge in the distance.

{[h]The bell tower}
There are dozens of images of lions spiralling up the tower. Only three of the four floors remain above water. There are three wooden skiffs jutting off of it.
We can see one hobgoblin armed with a bow at the top of the tower. It's about 60ft above us. He doesn't seem to see us, he seems to also be focused on the barge to the south. Brande points out the hobgoblin to Aleya so that she can message everyone else in the party.
Ganraz tells Gareth to turn into a spider and sneak up to the top to have a scout, and then report back. He shimmies his little legs along the water, and makes it to the wall of the tower. He has a peep into each level as he climbs up. On the first floor, he can see two goblins and one hobgoblin sitting at a table. They appear to be playing some sort of game.
Aleya and Gareth start an information relay with Message, so the party are kept up to date on what he can see.
On the second level there's a hobgoblin in red robes with a red hand emblazoned on it, and three other goblins. At the top, there's another hobgoblin who's patrolling the sides of the tower, whilst the archer keeps an eye on the barge, and another archer stands ready. None of them notice the little spider boi. They don't have the moon zoom eyes.
Through Message, we communicate with Gareth and ask if the trapdoor on the top floor can be blocked, or the ladder can be moved, so that no-one else can get up to the bell. Gareth thinks it can.
[Players take a quick break]
[In the break, Ganraz formulates a plan. Angelo does too. They turn out to both have the same plan.]
The plan is generally that Angelo will turn Vilgrim and Seamus invisible, they go up to the top to join Gareth, whilst Ganraz, Jhen, Brande and Angelo go downstairs. The four guys at the bottom will fight upwards, whilst the others take the top and make sure nobody can get through the trapdoor.
Angelo helps Ganraz get back into his armour.

{[h]Stealth Team 7}
Seamus casts Spider Climb on himself. He then picks up Vilgrim, and Angelo steps forwards to cast Invisibility on both of them. Whilst they're climbing up, Ganraz checks whether the door is locked. It doesn't appear to have a visible lock, but it doesn't look like it.
Seamus and Vilgrim both roll another stealth check, and make it with no problem. They carefully climb up, and they reach the border of the Pass Without Trace. They manage to climb over with no problem, and get into position. Gareth doesn't see them come up, because they're invisible. The four of us at the bottom of the tower wait until Angelo feels his Invisibility break.
Angelo casts Message for the first time, hoping it works, and asks Ganraz if he'd like him to try to put the whole bottom floor to sleep. The spell does work, and he gives Angelo the go-ahead. [He gets to shh things, oooooh]

Vilgrim sneaks up to one of the hobgoblin archers, who has literally no idea he's there. He deals 37 damage. He is definitely dead. Angelo feels his spell break and tells the others.
Seamus also gets to be part of the surprise round, because he knew it was coming. He attacks the other archer, and deals 7 damage. He swings again but misses that time. He uses his bonus action to boot up his arm shield, and moves towards the trapdoor.
Gareth is also part of the surprise round, so he casts Hold Person on the archer and the hobgoblin. The hobgoblin fails and is held, but the archer saves.
Brande was holding his action; he casts Minor Illusion, creating a sound up the stairwell to draw the attention of the bottom floor goblins. Oh.

{[h]Roll for initiative}
{[b]Initiative order:} Brande, Vilgrim, Angelo, Ganraz, Seamus, Gareth
Seamus and Vilgrim see the red robed figure sprint up through the trapdoor. He can see the chaos unfolding, and shouts something in goblin, gesturing towards the bell. As his action, he summons two whips of fire. He uses his bonus action to assume a defensive stance. [We thought he was a super caster, but he's a monk boi]
The orange hobgoblin on the top of the tower follows the order, and moves to pick up the beater that will ring the bell. He moves towards the bell, getting ready to strike.
Two of the goblins on the bottom floor sprint up the stairs towards the sound. The green hobgoblin stays.
Brande is next; he slams through the door, using his sharpshooter to hit the hobgoblin. He deals 23 damage, killing him instantly. He moves fully into the room, so he can try to shoot up the stairs at one of the fleeing goblins. He does so, but it hits the stairwell.
Vilgrim is up. His player asks the DM if it's possible for Vilgrim to try to deaden the sound by leaning on the bell or something. He moves between the hobgoblin and the bell, and tries to attack him. He deals a total of 9 damage.
Angelo moves in to where Brande is, and can now see the two goblins on the stairs, as well as a hobgoblin coming downstairs from above. He raises a hand, calling out, "lóre" and casts Sleep. He rolls 47 [but it doesn't technically count as damage, damn] and puts the two closest goblins to sleep. He then calls over his shoulder to Ganraz, saying, "That won't last long, so move quickly." Bardic Inspiration.
Ganraz dashes past Angelo and Brande, sprinting up the stairs. He moves past the unconscious goblins.
Seamus is up, and he moves towards the goblin with the beater. He deals 9 points of slashing damage and 1 fire damage. The goblin is now on fire.
Gareth moves towards the goblin he cast Hold Person on. He tries to attack him but can't get through his armour. He tries to grab the scimitar.
The goblin Gareth is holding is still paralyzed. Ganraz hears someone upstairs shouting for two more to go up, and the voice will head down. A more heavily armoured hobgoblin comes down the stairs to intercept Ganraz. The monk boi makes two attacks against Vilgrim; the first is a nat 20, but the second misses. He deals 7 bludgeoning damage and 4 fire because Vilgrim dodges. The monk boi uses flurry of blows on Vilgrim, dealing 7 bludgeoning and 5 fire. The green Lurker on the stairs tries to shoot Angelo, but misses. The orange goblin with the beater takes another 3 fire damage, but he's still up. It moves towards the bell, and Seamus has a chance to use his attack of opportunity. He deals another 9 points of damage, killing him before he begins to try to ring the bell. Seamus' axe comes down and severs his arms.
Brande's turn. He moves to the stairs, so now he can see the armoured hobgoblin that's come down to intercept Ganraz. He makes two shots, using his Hunter's Mark. His first hits, dealing 10 piercing damage. His second is a 17, which misses.
Vilgrim drops his dagger and shortsword, drawing his bow and notching a flesh-eater arrow. He tries to shoot at the monk boi, but it misses.
Angelo looks up and takes his wand off of the back of his belt. He casts Magic Missile, dealing 16 damage to the armoured hobgoblin. He then bardic inspires Brande.
Ganraz steps over the unconscious boi, and makes two attacks on the armoured hobgoblin. He deals 16 damage, and then 13. Vraath's Frost pierces his sternum, turning him to ice, and then he shatters. He definitely dead.
Seamus uses a Branding Smite on the monk boi. He deals 9 slashing damage and 6 radiant damage. He's looking fairly hurt, one of his arms bleeding.
Gareth deals 18 damage, abruptly ending his Hold Person spell. The poor hobgoblin was literally defenceless.
There are only two hobgoblins left. The red hobgoblin on the top floor spends his action picking up the beater. The other hobgoblin on the top floor attacks Seamus. He takes 23 points of slashing damage, which is absorbed by his shield.
The monk tries to attack Seamus. The first misses, the second hits. He deals 6 damage total. The monk tries to use Flurry of Blows again. The first attack misses, the second hits. Deals 13 damage. The green goblin facing Ganraz bonus action disengages, notches a flesh eater arrow and rolls a nat 20. Ganraz takes 13 piercing, and 8 acid damage. The goblin continues his movement to get up to the top floor.
Brande turns to Angelo and asks if the goblins on the stairs are incapacitated. Angelo confirms that they'll be asleep for a minute. Brande dashes up the stairs.
Vilgrim bonus action disengages, and notches another flesheater arrow. The hobgoblin carrying the beater takes 6 piercing damage and 7 acid damage. That hobgoblin is dead.
Angelo sprints up the stairs, shouting encouragement to Ganraz, bardicly inspiring him.
Ganraz takes another 4 acid damage. He charges up the remainder of the stairs, catching up to the goblin that ran away from him before. His first attack misses, even with Bardic Inspiration, but his second hits, so he deals 11 damage. The goblin is still up, but looking terrified.
Seamus is up. He uses his arm coils to grab the beater from the floor. As he pulls it back to him, he swings wide and slams it into the back of the monk's head before he yeets it off the tower. It deals 15 damage.
Gareth moves to try to attack the monk again. He misses.
The monk's flame whips fade. He uses Step of the Wind to disengage, and then runs and jumps off the edge of the tower. He dives into the water, and has disappeared from view. Well, shitu.
There's only one hobgoblin left on the top floor. He panics, seeing that he can't fight this group of people alone. So he jumps off the side of the tower. He takes 7 fall damage, but he's still alive.
Brande moves up to the next level, where Ganraz is. He takes a shot at the goblin that Ganraz hit. He deals 11 piercing damage. The goblin is still up. His second shot also hits, dealing 15 damage. He moves towards the ladder.

{[h]We're technically out of combat now}
Vilgrim shouts down the stairs, "Two of them have jumped!" and runs to the edge of the tower. He can see the hobgoblin that jumped, who's splashing and flailing in the water because of his armour. Vilgrim can't see the monk. He takes a shot at the hobgoblin. 6 damage, he dead.
Brande goes up the ladder to the top floor. Ganraz goes down the stairs, killing one of the sleeping goblins and tying up the other. Angelo gives Ganraz 8hp back with Healing Word.
Vilgrim and Brande both roll perception, and they can see the monk boi now. Brande puts his hunter's mark on him. Vilgrim rolls a nat 20, so he notches one of Ota's arrows. The sneaky gnome boi deals 22 damage to the monk. It pierces his heart, and he falls onto his side, sliding back into the water.

{[h]Now we're definitely out of combat}
Vilgrim, Brande, Seamus and Gareth on the top of the tower roll perception checks. Brande can see a silhouette flying back in our direction. It's carrying something large. It's going back towards the central building and hasn't noticed any movement in the tower where we are.
Brande immediately flattens himself against the wall, and grabs Vilgrim to yank him down with him. It's not necessary, as the dragon passes by without a glance in our direction.

We decide here that it's better to plan when we're all together again. So our session ends here. The DM tells us that next week will most likely be the most scary thing. Ruh roh. `

`{[h]Still in the tower}
We have about 15-18 minutes before Water Walk runs out. We think it'll take us about 4 or so minutes to reach the Lion Hall, where the dragon and the brood are.
Ganraz has tied up the goblin that Angelo put to sleep. He keeps moving down the stairs, so Angelo and Brande are left with him. Angelo lets Brande know he'll wake up in about 10 seconds, so we all go downstairs and the goblin wakes up. Seamus stays upstairs, checking to see if he can lower the bell so it can't be rung even after we've left. It would probably take time, so he doesn't bother trying.
Aleya and Vilgrim interrogate the goblin. Aleya goes straight for bad cop, and Vilgrim goes for badder cop by drawing one of his flesh-eater arrows. It doesn't work, he's not intimidated. He says he hopes Nurkel'Nak takes his time with us. Aleya kills him. Quickest interrogation ever.
We've agreed on some semblance of a plan; Stay stealthy until that is no longer an option, and the get fucking dangerous. Speed is key.
Aleya sends Lakrith up into the air to scout ahead. She can see through his eyes that there's large buildings, a lot of which are submerged, and a smaller building connected to a big building. There's a hole in the roof. There are also some torchlights in the area.
Whilst she's in her trance, people check on the rafts. We basically stealth bobsleighing these boats. Three a boat. Ganraz, Gareth and Brande are one team. Aleya, Vilgrim, Angelo are team 2. Seamus, Sheyla, Jhen are team 3. Gareth does a quick vibe check on the storm; he can tell it's going to hit within the next hour, hour and a half.
We all roll stealth checks. On average, we do pretty decently thanks to Jhen's Pass Without Trace. Vilgrim is basically invisible right now.

{[h]Forwards into darkness}
These buildings used to be grand, accented by eroded lion statues. We're being lashed by rain. As we get within 200ft, we start to see light emerging in the distance. We pull the boats towards a crumbling building, with a stairwell that we can step up on.
There's an impressive stone structure in the centre, half sunken in the lake. There are statues of heroes and a row of 12 pillars of marble. The third floor is partially collapsed, exposing the room to the sky. Two flights of wooden stairs lead up from the wooden walkway up to the ruined roof. There doesn't seem to be a visible door on the outside. Those who rolled above a 15 can see faint torchlight from the roof and within certain windows. We also notice silhouettes. There is an ogre, and various hobgoblins patrolling the wooden walkway. There are two goblins in Lurker armour looking out from the roof. Ganraz got the highest perception, and can see that the wooden fence built around the top of the roof on one of the smaller buildings appears to have been damaged and patched up. He can also see lights in the windows.
We do a quick out of character clarification of goals – Brood is the priority, Wyrmlord second, Dragon if necessary. Some flexibility will obviously have to occur if we get attacked by something whilst destroying the brood, we will defend ourselves.

{[h]Here we go boys, crunch time}
Ganraz suggests a plan. If we approach from the south, we can put the smaller building between us and them, to avoid being seen for as long as possible. Aleya reminds everyone that if it's all going to shit, we should leave immediately. There are boats on the platform where the ogre and goblins and hobgoblins are, so if we need to grab and dash we can.
Aleya gets her barrel of oil from Ganraz's Bag of Holding, and distributes oil amongst the party. Including giving a vial of oil to Lakrith. She's actually using the bird as a grenade.
{[b]Initiative order:} Aleya, Vilgrim, Brande, Angelo, Sheyla, Ganraz, Seamus, Jhen, Gareth.
{[b]We have 15 rounds of Water Walk left.} There's 25ft of wall we're hiding behind. We can go round or try to climb.
Aleya sneaks forwards, rolling a stealth of 18. She isn't spotted as she creeps along the wall, taking out a handaxe and holding her action for when we get noticed.
Vilgrim attempts to climb, with Brande's help. He makes it about 20ft, and just about manages to get a grip on the wood. He hasn't climbed over, so he can't see beyond it. He trusts his bonus action and tries to climb again. He hasn't lost his grip, but he hasn't got a handhold.
Brande has used his action, so he moves around to the corner in the direction of Aleya.
Angelo casts Message to Ganraz, telling him to be careful because he's better to everyone alive, and stealth casts Bardic Inspiration through his message. He then moves to the corner where Ganraz and Brande are, still hidden from sight.
Sheyla has seen this group of very independent people start to scatter and do their own thing. Same goal, vastly different execution. She moves in the opposite direction, peering around the other corner. She can now see two guards around the back of the building.
Ganraz moves to where Aleya is and takes the dodge action. He rolls a 23 on his stealth. The guards are still unaware of the two approaching fighters.
Seamus judges the distance from the water's surface to the top. He makes a quick investigation to determine whether he'd fall straight into the building if he went up, and he can see that there'd probably be some section to stand on. If it took some impacts, it might crumble. He uses his grapple arm to shoot upwards, grabbing Vilgrim on the way up, and finds himself on the roof of the building. He peers down through the massive hole and can see large eggs half submerged in water. They seem to be pulsing gently, covered in slime. There's something highly unnatural about them. He rolls an arcana check, and can tell those are some fucked up looking eggs.
Jhen moves to where Aleya and Ganraz are. He gets 31 on his stealth check.
Gareth sees a bunch of people scattering in various directions. He wild shapes, turning into a big spooder, and makes it up to where Seamus and Vilgrim are.
{[b]We have 14 rounds of Water Walk left.}
Aleya holds position.
Vilgrim turns to Jastiz and tells him to get Aleya's attention. The magpie flies down to Aleya, landing on her shoulder and poking her. She backs up a little, towards Brande. He then clambers over the wooden palisade, and looks into the room more closely. He can see two hobgoblin guards, so he points them out to Seamus and Gareth.
Brande can't do anything really, but he is just as confused as Aleya.
Angelo messages Vilgrim, asking why Jastiz is attacking Aleya. Vilgrim tells him that the brood is inside the building, and lightly guarded. Angelo tells everyone else via message. Everyone knows that the brood is here now.
Ganraz creeps up further, and can now see the ogre on the platform. He moves his Hunter's Mark onto the ogre, and takes the dodge action again.
Seamus can see all the eggs, and knows about the two guards. He climbs up over onto the roof, keeping low, and sneaks around to the other side. He can see more eggs now, and two points of light. He can hear a low, clicking snarl. A Razor Fiend is looking directly at him.

[We break for dinner]

{[h]It's polymorph time}
Initiative order: Aleya, Vilgrim, Brande, Angelo, Sheyla, Ganraz, hobgoblin horde, Seamus, ogres, Jhen, Razor fiend, Gareth
Vilgrim hears the clicking noise beneath him. He can guess what it is, even if he can't see it. He moves to his left, bonus action hiding, and is not seen by anyone below. The guards below look nervous, like they're scared of the razor fiend. Understandable. Vilgrim preps his bow, notching one of his flesh-eater arrows. He deals 52 damage, holy shit. It looks straight up at Vilgrim, but one of its wings is being eaten through with acid.
Seamus casts Firebolt, dealing 18 fire damage to the razor fiend. It is somehow still up. He then ducks down behind the wooden palisade to keep safe from the archers on the other roof.
The razor fiend is looking pretty pissed. It takes another 4 acid damage from Vilgrim's arrow. It tries to leap up to where Seamus, Vilgrim and Gareth are, but it doesn't make it. It slams down into the chamber below, and terrifies the hobgoblins below.
Gareth turns back into himself. He casts Call Lightning, dealing 18 damage to the razor fiend, and 9 damage to a cluster of eggs. Everything heard that thunder.
Stealth is out the window, boys.
{[b]13 rounds of Water Walk left.}
First up, someone. Something happens. Ruh roh.
Aleya moves forwards, blocking the door. She shoots a ray of frost, dealing 10 damage to the closest hobgoblin. She says ‘this is fucking dumb' and then activates her sword.
Vilgrim takes aim at the razor fiend, dealing 23 damage. His arrow sinks straight into its throat, cutting off its breath weapon attack. It is definitely dead.
Brande sprints up the side of the building. He takes a shot at the blue archer on the roof, but misses. His second attack deals 15 piercing damage.
Angelo turns invisible and moves to where Brande is, so that he can see everything happening, but nothing can see him.
Next, someone does something.
Sheyla Misty Steps at the green guard at the back of the building, which was her held action. She attacks twice, dealing first 9 damage, and then her second attack deals 12 damage. That is one dead hobgoblin. Then Sheyla runs towards where Aleya is.
Ganraz moves to the front of the group and sets up his dodge action again.
The hobgoblins are next. Two of them run to engage Ganraz. They're all converging on us, so this will be interesting. There are now four archers. One shot misses Ganraz. One shot at Aleya missed. One shot at Brande, a flesh-eater arrow, deals 12 piercing and 4 acid damage. The second shot at Brande deals 8 piercing. The hobgoblin commander swings at Ganraz, but misses. A second hobgoblin misses Ganraz too.
Seamus tries to grapple one of the hobgoblins in the brood chamber, but it dodges out of the way. So, he tries again, but still misses. This hobgoblin is having a terrifying time.
The ogre runs up to where Ganraz is engaging all the things. It completely misses with its club. Two more appear on the rooftop where the archers are, and jump down to join the fray. The blue one takes 9 bludgeoning damage from falling. The other lands perfectly.
Jhen runs forwards and shifts. He takes two shots at the green ogre. His first attack hits, dealing 11 piercing damage.
Gareth uses his lightning to detonate the rest of the eggs, dealing 11 damage. There are 6 eggs left. He then ducks behind cover.
Something happens somewhere.
We see a large, two-headed giant run out onto the roof, double-wielding clubs. It looks both pissed and amused.
Another figure appears, wielding a beautiful ornate bow that looks like it's blurring. He shouts in goblin, ‘You, target that one.' A Lurker shoots at Ganraz, but misses completely. Wyrmlord Saarvith is embarrassed by their incompetence. He makes two shots at Aleya with his magical bow. His first attack hits, dealing 11 piercing damage, and the second deals 12 piercing and 5 acid damage.
{[b]12 rounds of Water Walking left.}
Aleya takes 3 more acid damage. She moves up to where Ganraz is, and uses Burning Hands at second level. She deals 18 fire damage to the blue hobgoblin, killing him instantly. The commander takes 9 damage. She uses her bonus action to use second wind, and then uses her action surge to send Lakrith towards the green ogre. With her hawk helping, she makes 2 regular attacks against the ogre. She deals 10 force damage, and then another 23 force damage. The ogre goes down. Lakrith uses the rest of his movement to fly back up out of melee range.
Vilgrim takes aim at the orange hobgoblin at the rear of the building. He misses. He dashes to another part of the roof to get a better view of the battlefield.
Brande is ready. He is the chosen one. He draws his bow, taking a deep breath, and fires his arrow. Where it impacts with the floor, fire spreads in a huge sphere. Fireball, motherfuckers. The Lurkers pass, as does Saarvith, but the ettin fails. The red ogre succeeds, as does the blue one. Purple hobgoblin fails. Those who fail take 32 fire damage, and the rest take 16. The purple hobgoblin gets annihilated. That's 8 targets, bois. The blue Lurker is dead. The others look pretty hurt. Saarvith looks pissed off.
Angelo steps forwards, breaking his invisibility to use his wand, dealing 24 damage with Magic Missile to Saarvith. The goblin doesn't go down, but he's now focused on Angelo. Using the rest of his movement, Angelo ducks back behind cover.
Something big is coming towards us. Shit.
Sheyla shifts and moves towards the red hobgoblin in front of her, but her first attack misses. Her second attack hits, dealing 11 damage. She takes his leg off at the knee, and he collapses, very dead.
Ganraz is up. Get ready with those quips boy. He does a quick bait and switch with Aleya, spending that superiority dice, and gives her a +5 to her AC until the end of his next turn. He charges at the blue ogre, spending another superiority dice to trip attack. He deals 15 damage, but doesn't quite manage to trip the ogre. It does stagger a little though, the sword seems to be doing its work. His second attack hits, dealing 8 damage.
Hobgoblins have realised it might not be the best plan to cluster. Green Lurker shoots at Ganraz, but misses. Orange Lurker shoots at Brande, which hits. Brande takes 12 piercing damage. Red Lurker takes a shot at Aleya, but misses because of her massive armour class. The commander tries to make an attack on Aleya, but the first is a nat 1 and the second misses because of her massive armour class. The pink hobgoblin throws a javelin at Jhen but misses. The orange hobgoblin dashes at Sheyla.
Seamus rushes to the edge of the roof, and uses his arm coils on the pink hobgoblin. He succeeds, and pulls him up to the roof. He swings his hand axe, but misses.
The red ogre hurls a javelin at Brande, but it misses. The blue ogre tries to attack Ganraz, but misses.
Jhen places his Hunter's Mark on the commander, and rolls two nat 1s.
Gareth sees Saarvith, and uses his lightning on him. The red Lurker fails, and the ettin and Saarvith succeed. The red Lurker is dead, taking the full 20 damage. The ettin is looking hurt, as both it and Saarvith take 10.
The ettin runs to engage Sheyla. It makes two attacks. The first is a nat 20, dealing 25 points of slashing damage. The second deals 17 piercing.
We see a robed hobgoblin appear on the rooftop, using a quarterstaff to walk. He surveys the scene, and then says, "Come now, this is pointless. Gaze upon her majesty." Swirls of smoke and colour appear above Angelo, Brande and Jhen. But all three save, and are not captivated by his hypnotic pattern. Frustrated, he bardicly inspires one of his minions.
Saarvith is unimpressed by Nurkel'Nak's display. He fires at Brande. There was no noise, just pain. Brande takes 13 piercing damage. There is currently a bubble of silence around Brande, which encompasses Angelo too. Neither of them can speak. There goes half of Angelo's spell list. He then takes another shot at Angelo, who takes 12 piercing damage. Saarvith then appears in front of Angelo in a whirl of shadows.
{[b]11 rounds of Water Walk left}
Aleya repositions, and the yellow hobgoblin tries to swing at her but misses. She then uses her green-flame blade on the ettin, dealing 13 force and 5 fire, and the commander takes 11 fire damage.
Vilgrim takes aim at the ettin. He deals a total of 22 damage. The ettin is looking really hurt.
Brande can't speak. He limps towards a pillar, tucking behind it. He has stepped out of the bubble of silence, and assesses his situation. He casts hex on Saarvith, giving him disadvantage against wisdom saving throws. He tries to shoot Saarvith but it misses.
Angelo steps to his left, and reflexively grabs his locket. He deals 27 damage to the pink hobgoblin, and 14 to Saarvith. Four lights unfurl around him, and slowly take form as butterflies. They are translucent but bordered with silver filigree, and their wings slice through skin. But they don't harm Seamus.
Sheyla is surrounded by a lot of crazy right now. She uses her bonus action to heal herself by 10 points. She uses her shifter ability to attack the ettin, smiting him. She deals 14 damage, and the ettin is looking pretty hurt. She then runs across the water. The ettin and the orange hobgoblin get attacks of opportunity. She takes 8 from the ettin, and the hobgoblin misses.
Ganraz is up. ‘Slap an ogre, let's do it.' He deals 13 slashing damage, and 7 frost damage. He slides under its legs and slashes through its belly as he moves on to the red ogre. His second attack is against the red ogre deals 15 slashing damage and 3 frost. The red ogre looks hurt. He action surges, and his first attack deals 12 slashing damage and 3 frost. His second attack deals 12 slashing damage, and 9 frost. That is yet another dead ogre.
The hobgoblins are up. The orange hobgoblin hits Aleya, dealing 23 slashing damage. The commander makes two attacks against Aleya, but both miss. The two Lurkers that remain try to attack Ganraz, but the first attack misses. The orange Lurker shoots at Ganraz too, and hits. It deals 9 piercing damage.
Seamus drops down from the roof, and takes 3 bludgeoning damage. He runs to engage Saarvith. His first attack hits, dealing 8 piercing damage. Saarvith is walking on the water as well, we just notice.
Jhen is up. He shoots at the commander, dealing 10 damage on his first attack, and 13 on the second one. The commander is dead. He moves his Hunter's Mark to Saarvith.
Gareth zaps the ettin and the orange hobgoblin. The ettin takes 17 damage, and the orange hobgoblin takes 8 damage. The lightning strikes right in the middle of the ettin's heads, incinerating the corpse.
Nurkel'Nak is next. He reaches out towards Ganraz and Aleya, and says, ‘I am not your enemy. She is.' He tries to cast Confusion on Aleya, but Angelo counterspells with a nat20. There's only room for one bard here.
Saarvith's turn. He takes 13 damage from Angelo's Spirit Guardians. He then shoots at Brande, using his teleporter arrows to appear next to Brande. He deals 13 damage with that. Saarvith takes 6 fire damage from Brande's hellish rebuke.
{[b]10 rounds of Water Walk left}
Aleya charges up to where the green hobgoblin is. She uses burning hands, dealing 16 fire damage to two hobgoblins.
Vilgrim repositions to get within sneak attack range. He shoots at Saarvith, dealing 24 damage.
Brande rolls a death save. He succeeds.
Angelo runs after Saarvith, who just hurt Brande. He casts Healing Word on Brande, giving him 12hp back. Brande rolls for injury and rolls a 1. He receives a permanent wound, and his movement is permanently reduced by 5ft.
We hear the beating of heavy wings. A large black dragon lifts up into the air, landing on the rubble roof. He looks at Seamus, and then Ganraz, and smiles. ‘Touched by prophecy. Delicious.' Everyone has to roll a wisdom saving throw. Everyone under 15 is frightened. Saarvith shouts something in draconic. Regiarix looks over and we see his face is horribly scared in one place. He flies over, hovers near Saarvith, and then vomits acid on Angelo and Jhen. Jhen takes 53 damage, and Angelo takes 27 damage. The butterflies harass the dragon, dealing 14 damage. Angelo maintains his concentration, so his butterflies stick around.
Sheyla takes out her longbow, shooting at Saarvith. Her first attack missed, but her second hits. She deals 7 damage. Saarvith is looking really hurt. He seems to be trying to move towards Regiarix. She then moves around to engage the yellow hobgoblin.
Ganraz is frightened. He decides it's better to get the hobgoblins instead of the dragon. His first attack on the green hobgoblin misses. His second also misses. He has to roll a wisdom saving throw, and is still afraid of the dragon.
The green hobgoblin tries to hit Ganraz, but misses. Another hobgoblin tries to shoot at Angelo, but he uses shield. Aleya notices, and is surprised because she's never seen him use that before.
Seamus is frightened. He tries to use Firebolt on Saarvith, but just misses. He moves away from the dragon, who looked at him previously as though he knew Seamus. He fails his wisdom saving throw.
Jhen is frightened. He's sensible and moves away. He puts his Hunter's Mark on Saarvith. His first attack misses, as does his second. He fails his wisdom saving throw.
Gareth is frightened. He deals 13 damage to the dragon. He fails his wisdom saving throw.
Nurkel'Nak tries to cast Hold Person on Angelo, but he rolls a 19 widsom save, suck my bardic dick.
Saarvith starts to run towards Regiarix. But Angelo's butterflies are still active. Like homing missiles, the four spirits darts forwards and shred him to pieces. Wyrmlord Saarvith is dead. Regiarix looks at Angelo, and roars, furious.
{[b]9 rounds of Water Walk left}
Aleya moves forwards, casting Thunderwave. The fails take 15 thunder damage and the succeeds take 8. Three die instantly. Ganraz's ears are ringing, but he can hear Aleya shout, ‘Sorry Ganraz!' She then chugs her healing potion, getting back hella health. She succeeds on her wisdom saving throw.
Vilgrim gets out a flesh-eater arrow and deals 20 damage to Regiarix.
Brande is frightened. As a bonus action, he casts Zephyr's Strike on himself. He backs up rapidly, putting distance between himself and the dragon, and tries to shoot. His first attack misses, as does his second. In the presence of this dragon, he feels this burning hatred begin to rise within him. Brande succeeds his wisdom saving throw.
Angelo runs from the dragon, and draws forth his Staff of Orchids. A sense of tranquillity washes over him as he hopes this druid magic works. A single petal falls from the orchid, pressing against Angelo's chest. Another 5 spread outwards, touching Ganraz, Seamus, Sheyla, Vilgrim and Jhen. He gives everyone 23hp back.
Regiarix launches after Angelo, and makes 3 attacks, dealing 19 damage, 12 slashing damage, 15 damage. Angelo is unconscious. The water walking effect is immediately cancelled. Brande, Angelo, Seamus, and Jhen all plunge into water. Angelo is sinking, but water breathing keeps him alive. Regiarix doesn't know this, so he flies over the top of the brood building. He shouts to Nurkel'Nak to "get the device."
Sheyla deals 12 damage to the yellow hobgoblin, killing him instantly. She then shoots at Regiarix, dealing 5 damage.
Ganraz moves up the steps. He can see Nurkel'Nak moving towards the stairs, and he goes to intercept him. Technically he now can't see the dragon, so he doesn't have disadvantage even though he's frightened of it. He moves his Hunter's Mark to Nurkel'Nak, and rolls his wisdom save.
There is one hobgoblin left alive. He tries to attack Ganraz, and does hit, dealing 10 damage.
Seamus is up. He's treading water, and uses his grapple arm to get out of it. From the dock, he then looks around for Angelo. He can't see him, so he moves around to the other platform.
Jhen is still terrified of the dragon, so he dives under water. He does succeed his wisdom saving throw.
Gareth zaps the eggs. He deals 17 damage, destroying the rest of the eggs. Hell yeah, it's ya boi. He succeeds his wisdom saving throw.
Nurkel'Nak is next. He casts Hypnotic Pattern on Ganraz and Aleya, and the last remaining hobgoblin. They all save, so it has no effect. So he makes a run for the stairs. Ganraz gets his attack of opportunity. Nurkel'Nak uses cutting words, but it's not enough to save himself. Ganraz deals 25 slashing damage, and 2 frost, and it's a trip attack. Nurkel'Nak succeeds and can keep running, but he's still within Aleya and Ganraz distance.
Aleya storms after him, with Lakrith giving her advantage, and deals first 13 force and then 11 force. She kicks him down the stairs, walks down after him, and then picks up his limp body, igniting her sword right through him. His dying words are ‘Exquisite pain.'
Regiarix is flying about 5ft above Vilgrim. He drops his bow, drawing his short sword. He tries to attack, but it glances off of his scales. He bonus action disengages.
Brande cannot swim. The rage within him takes over, and he hisses, ‘Rise.' He soars up out of the water, and he flies back towards the group. His Hunter's Mark is gone.
Angelo rolls a death save. He succeeds. He's pretty much at the bottom now, as it's 15ft deep.
Regiarix is next. Oh boi. He's got his breath weapon back. Oh yikes. He sees the last of the eggs sizzling and popping, and sees his minions dead. His friend Saarvith is dead, and he assumes Nurkel'Nak is gone. He breathes acid on Gareth and Vilgrim. Gareth takes 59 points of acid damage. Vilgrim takes 28. Regiarix then flies upwards 20ft.
Sheyla keeps longbowing him. Both of her shots hit. She deals 16 damage. The dragon is looking pretty hurt.
Ganraz tries to hit the hobgoblin. His first attack misses, but his second hits. He deals 9 damage and 2 frost damage. The hobgoblin is dead. He moves so he can see the dragon. He reaches into his pack for something he's going to set up next turn.
Seamus is up. He keeps cantripping the dragon. He casts Firebolt but misses. He rolls a wisdom save, and succeeds. He's no longer afraid.
Jhen is no longer afraid of the dragon. He is still underwater, and swims towards where he saw Angelo go under.
Gareth is feeling extwa cwispy. He recasts Call Lightning on Regiarix, and the dragon fails with a nat 1. He deals 20 damage. Regiarix is looking pretty bad.
Aleya moves towards the edge of the roof, and casts Magic Missile on the dragon. She deals 12 damage.
Brande is up. Literally. He's still flying, and he hates this creature more than he's ever hated anything in his life. He cannot see Angelo. He shoots at Regiarix. 18 hits, dealing 8 piercing damage, and his second attack deals 11 piercing damage. He flies straight upwards 60ft, to get a bird's eye view.
Angelo rolls another death save. He succeeds.
Regiarix gets his breath weapon back. He descends 10ft, unleashing his breath weapon on Vilgrim and Gareth. He deals 40 acid damage, halved to 20 for Vilgrim. They are both down. Sheyla is also hit, taking 20 acid damage. The dragon then flies upwards, and says, ‘Her wrath is coming. The prophecy will be fulfilled.' He then turns and flies south.
Sheyla moves along the walkway. Regiarix is out of range of her moonbeam. She then dives into the water, as she saw where Angelo went under. She grabs him, but can't drag him up yet.
Ganraz makes his way down the walkway, and uses Commander's Strike to tell Brande to kill the fleeing dragon. Brande shoots at him, dealing another 15 piercing damage. Regiarix keeps going.
Seamus pulls himself up onto the roof with his arm coils. He preps to heal both Gareth and Vilgrim.
Jhen is also swimming down to where Angelo is.
Gareth fails his first death save.
Aleya moves down to where Ganraz is.
Vilgrim fails his first death save.
Brande chases after the dragon, still enraged by its presence. He takes another two shots at the dragon. His first attack hits, dealing 12 damage, and his second attack deals another 12 damage.
Angelo rolls another save, and succeeds. He will start drowning soon unless someone gets him to the surface though.
Regiarix turns around, pissed off by Brande's attack. He snarls, ‘You smell of cinder', and makes 3 attacks against Brande. The first two hit, dealing 13 damage, knocking Brande unconscious. [Horror sweeps the party as we realise that Brande is 60ft in the air, can't swim, and is nowhere near the rest of us]. Brande immediately fails 2 saving throws and plummets to the ground. Seamus can see Brande, and casts Feather Fall as a reaction, so he saves Brande from fall damage.
Sheyla is next. She uses her Lay on Hands, and gives him 1hp. Angelo wakes up, and immediately chokes on water. There's a momentary panic, and Sheyla drags him upwards. We both break the surface, gasping for air. Angelo rolls an injury roll, but nothing happens.
Ganraz uses his bonus action to draw a crossbow from his pack, sticking a bolt in, and takes two shots at the dragon. His first attack misses, and his second just misses by 1.
Seamus casts Cure Wounds on Gareth, who regains 8hp. Gareth rolls for injury, but he's also fine. Seamus encourages him by letting him know he's still handsome.
Jhen swims to the surface, and sees Brande fall into the water. He starts swimming after the falling genasi.
Gareth heals Vilgrim, giving him 5hp back. Vilgrim also rolls an injury roll, but he's fine too.
Aleya can't really do anything.
Vilgrim is awake now. He gets over to his bow and grabs it.
Brande has to roll his first death save. He succeeds.
Angelo is alive, thank fuck. He takes a moment to cough up water, croak a quick thanks to Sheyla, and then sees Brande hits the water. He knows Brande can't swim. So he takes a second to collect himself, makes a quick decision, and then dashes towards Brande.
Regiarix is flying away from us now, pleased with himself for swatting the genasi.
Sheyla swims to the side of the walkway, grumbling about being too nice.
Ganraz uses his last superiority dice, telling Vilgrim to take one last shot at Regiarix. Vilgrim rolls a NAT 20 WITH DISADVANTAGE.

{[i]That face when the gnome rolls two nat 20s in a row and snipes a dragon.}
The party loses their fucking minds. He draws forth one of Ota's arrows, dealing 25 points of damage. Regiarix flails in the air, regains height, and keeps going. Fuck. Regiarix only had 14hp left. He's flying off into the darkness.
Seamus makes an attack to try and grapple Brande. He yanks the drowning genasi out of the water.
Gareth heals Brande, giving him 8hp back.
As well as the permanent walking speed reduction, he has temporary nerve damage from the acidic bite of Regiarix. He'll need two days of full rest to get rid of it.

And we end our session here, battered and bloodied but somehow still alive. `

`{[h]Still in Rhest}
We are, somehow, alive.
[It's now 17 Eyre, although it's very early in the morning]
Water Breathing and Water Walk have both faded. Angelo swims back to the walkway, but doesn't immediately get out, taking a moment to catch his breath. Brande is alive. Ganraz and Aleya go to investigate the area where Nurkel'Nak died. Aleya does a quick cast of Detect Magic, and detect multiple sources from the area where Saarvith went down. Sheyla's armour is also magical. She then follows Ganraz to investigate.
Nurkel'Nak is face-first on the ground. He's wearing a dark red robe, and Aleya can detect some faint enchantment from him. She rolls him over. He has a dagger that looks more like a serrated scalpel. There's a pearl around his neck on a chain, which she takes and moves on. As they go on, Aleya apologises again for catching him in her spell before, as she misjudged it. Ganraz says it's ok, just some warning is appreciated.
There are two finely-made doors leading to either side of the room, and one big room. This was once a grand place, but now there's not much but bare walls, floors and rotting furs. Aleya asks him how he wants to do this, and they try the side doors first.
Outside, Seamus wants to try and fish Saarvith out of the water. He does so with his grapple arms, dragging him back to the walkway. There are holes all over his body from where Angelo's Spirit Guardians tore him up. He's still clutching his scimitar, due to rigor mortis, but he doesn't have his bow. Vilgrim has a quick rummage through his quiver. There are about 10 normal arrows, and 2 flesh-eater arrows. There are two arrows that seem to have diamond tips, and one with a curved red head, almost like a fishhook, and the arrow itself is made up of a dark red wood. He's also wearing a ring. Vilgrim swims out to get the bow, with Seamus' aid.
Brande and Angelo aren't doing anything. Angelo sits on the edge of the walkway, looking out into darkness. Brande's arm is shaking, and he can't tell if it's from leftover rage or adrenaline or what.
He's in control, but he's not entirely calm. He's also well aware that his leg is pretty fucked. Gareth sits down next to Brande, uncorking a flagon of ale (nobody knows where it came from).
Back in the chamber, Ganraz tries a door. It is locked. Aleya tries her door, and it swings open. She goes through, and can see a room that's well-organised but grim. Several barrels of water and a bloodstained mop are in the corner. There's a table with a variety of instruments. There's a chair in the middle of the room, with bloodstains around it. She shouts out to Ganraz that she's found a torture room. She doesn't sense any magic here. She enters a side room off of the torture room, and finds a bed and a desk with papers on.
Ganraz picks the lock on his door. He rolls a nat 1, so he gives up on his thieves tools, and kicks the door down. He's told to make a dex saving throw. As he does so, he hears a click and there's an explosion of arcane energy, and a spray of acid. He takes 27 acid damage. Aleya sprints to the sound of the explosion, and Ganraz's tools are now melted. She reaches into her backpack, and starts helping bandage Ganraz. The door seems to somehow still be locked. Turns out there's a glyph of warding on the door.
Hearing the explosion, Angelo snaps out of his daze and goes to investigate. He uses Prestidigitation on himself to dry off, and as he finds Ganraz inside he uses it on him too to wipe some of the acid off. Aleya sees Angelo and tells him that he looks like shit. He says nothing in response, doesn't even feel the sting of that remark.
Now that there are more people in the room, she goes back to the desk. After her investigation, she finds notes on shifters who had been caught and tortured by Nurkel'Nak, and how pain and damage affected them. It looked like he was both studying and torturing them, at least two victims. There are also notes from initial interrogations. She grabs the papers, and checks the drawers of the desk. There is a small pouch, and a small lockbox. Neither of these seem to radiate any magic. She goes back into the other room, and tosses the lockbox to Vilgrim.
Vilgrim backs out of the room as Ganraz begins his assault on the door. Angelo has stepped back, and Aleya is nearby now. Ganraz does slam through the door, and he is faced with a leopard, a crocodile and a bear. On closer inspection, they appear to be stuffed. There's a tapestry on the wall, showing a five headed dragon. There is a desk in this room too, which seem to have drawers. There are some notes in them, and some more equipment for taxidermy. Ganraz can read goblin, so the notes seem to be assignments of patrols. He'd need to take time to really decipher them, but it appears to discuss watching the lizardfolk tribes and who's out on long patrol. He pockets these. Seamus checks out the room that Ganraz is in. He checks out the ointments and things.
Aleya checks out the big double doors, and can sense some abjuration magic from them. She tries to open them. One swings open, dragging heavily across the ground, and the room beyond has a large hole in the floor and ceiling. The hole in the floor is filled with water. This may have once been some form of meeting chamber, but it lies in ruins. As she peers through the hole, she can see a similarsized room beneath, but it's flooded. Using her sword, she can see there are sparkles beneath the water. There seems to be the remains of a bison.
She calls Angelo into the room with her, and notices that he hasn't spoken since he got out of the water. She remarks that it's unusual, and asks if it's the first time he's been seriously hurt. He takes a minute to really come back into the room, and then replies, ‘No, it's not.' She does a quick insight check and can see he's not lying. She doesn't pry any further. She then asks him to keep watch whilst she takes off her armour and preps to swim down to where the coins are. He casts Light on her
before she goes in, so that she can swim unhindered by being unable to see and having to hold her sword.
Vilgrim checks out the lockbox. His hands are still shaking from the adrenaline, so he can't open it.
Brande peers out across the lake, and keeps an eye out for torchlight, but doesn't see the masses of groups like we did previously. He asks himself, ‘Is this what you wanted from me, Tine Siorai? Is this what it means to accept your tine?' There is no response.
Ganraz and Seamus are still in the fancy room. They do a quick sweep of the room, checking under the bed, checking the drawers, etc. They find a pouch of 200 silver pieces in the drawers. Under the bed, there's an iron chest. He pulls it out from under the bed, and as he grabs the side of it, nothing seems to happen. [The rest of the party are prepping for what kind of traps Ganraz might die by]. Seamus suggests he could have a go with his thieves tools, and Ganraz says he should give it a go and they can try to find a key after. He rolls an 18, but it's just not high enough to pick the lock. He looks for a weak point where he can try to axe it open. Ganraz has learned from his lesson though, and says he'll look for a key. Seamus can tell the lock is incredibly well made, and shows almost no signs of wear. He can also tell that this may be enchanted in some way.
Ganraz goes upstairs first, and says aloud to himself, ‘The nearest key.' His dragonmark will glow, and will locate the nearest key to him. He gets a sense of the direction. He's standing near the hole in the roof, so Angelo overhears him say this, but obviously has no idea what this means. He then follows the direction it takes him in, and is led to Saarvith. There are two keys, one of standard iron and one that's much more ornate. There's some sort of writing in a language that he does not understand. He takes it back to Seamus, and asks if he recognises the writing. Seamus can't speak draconic, so to him it looks like just runes.
Jhen and Sheyla join us, and Jhen asks if we should call the Talons.
Aleya, underwater, can see a pile of coins, and in the corner some ornate armour that has a lion's symbol on it. With her detect magic up, she can sense something behind the armour, and something near the bottom of the room. She surfaces, tells Angelo that she's going to bring up some of the stuff. There is a group effort going on, as she hunts down the two things she senses magic from. There are gold pieces, copper pieces around, and she manages to dig out a gem which looks like a topaz, with an ornate holding around it. She dives again for the other one behind the armour, and as soon as Seamus sees the armour, he can tell it's very well made. It's a material that he's familiar with, adamantine. The last thing Aleya pulls out is a battleaxe, with a slightly curved handle at the end, and the blade has snarling lion motifs. It appears to be edged with stone instead of metal and gives off a sense of magic. She swims back and gets out of the water.
As she gets out, Angelo silently casts Prestidigitation on her, drying her off. Seamus checks out the magical battleaxe, and it looks almost like the stone has been marbled into the steel just at the fringes. It's definitely the work of an artificer.
Sheyla asks if we should summon the owls, and Aleya agrees that it's best to do so whilst we finish looting. Ganraz brings out the chest from the other room, and Aleya says she will look at everything when we get back to safety.
Vilgrim has had more time to figure out his lockbox and finds a ruby bracelet. There's also another pouch, which contains 100 gold.

{[h]Leaving Rhest}
We fire off two signalling arrows, and Sheyla tells us that we have about 15 minutes until the owls get here. Vilgrim goes to harvest the razor fiend. As he does so, he notices the eggs, and dips a finger in one to taste. He immediately spits, as it tastes of sulphur. He does manage to get everything that Ota wanted.
We don't hear the owls coming, but we see these giant owls swooping down to the roof. Six or seven owls total. Killiar and other members of the Talons are all there, and they dismount, arrows at the ready. It's not necessary, but fair. Killiar approaches and finds us all alive. He asks if it's done, and Aleya says it is. Some of the shifters take some of the tension off of their bows, now that they know the dragon isn't nearby. She then gives Killiar the notes she found on shifters, and says she doubts it'll be easy for him, but he deserved to know. She knows what it's like to lose friends.
Aleya helps Brande onto an owl, and he doesn't say anything.
Brande grips tighter as we take off, and we are beaten, bloodied but victorious. The shifters aren't talking, the wind and rain are lashing against us, and it begins to set in that holy shit, we just did that.
Behind us, we see the city of Rhest disappearing. Fatigue is now hitting us.
[It's about 4am on the 17th Eyre]

{[h]Back in Starsong Hill}
We arrive, exhausted. All the great trees are dancing in the wind. We are set down before the guest lodges, and Killiar dismounts to talk to us. He tells us that we have done a great thing today. They have been hunting razor fiends whilst we were fighting, and this event will call for a tribe meeting, which will occur later today, some time in the afternoon.
All of the owl riders make their clan salute towards us, and take off towards the great nests.
Before we go up, Sheyla and Jhen speak to us. Sheyla is impressed by how capable we apparently are. Jhen is pleased that Sheyla is ok. We ascend up the lifting platform, which is noticeably more unstable that last time due to the storm.
It's warm inside, and the hammocks are ready for us. There are furs on the floors. Brande goes straight to a hammock and passes out. Aleya casts Alarm and also goes to bed. Vilgrim tests the bow he got from Saarvith, and it makes no sense as he draws the string. It feels almost like silk. He takes the time to attune to it. Angelo sits by himself for a while before sleeping, lost in his own thoughts, before finally crawling into bed.

{[h]At night}
DM: Brande.
The party: Oh no.
As he sleeps, he feels the burning of the acid, and the anger… And though there's no visual, he feels heat. He hears a voice… ‘You have my fire. But you must learn to let it smoulder. Ours is a fury that can burn too hot. Patience.'
Brande accepts, saying that Tine Siorai's will is his.

{[h]In the morning}
It's about 11am.
Brande wakes up early, going down to ground level and finding somewhere quiet to sit and spend some time by himself. He can see people are moving towards the Ancestor Tree. He summons his flame, trying to see if there's any difference, but there's no change.
He goes off to do a bit of hunting to try and catch something for the party. He misses his first prey, but spends the time trying to get something else. He picks off a few tropical birds.
Angelo spends ten more minutes in bed, he can't be bothered to get up yet. Aleya has a bath before she does anything else.
Aleya casts Comprehend Languages, and can see that the key says, in draconic, ‘Silent Storm.' She tells this to Ganraz and Seamus. She also can detect some abjuration on the iron chest we looted, but also something necromantic. Both Ganraz and Seamus say fuck it, they want to open it. And before Seamus puts the key in, Ganraz tells him to try turning the key the wrong way first, but nothing happens. He turns it the correct way, and has to rolls a con save. He saves, and has dungeon delver, which is good because otherwise he would have taken 57 necrotic damage. He instead takes 15 damage. [14d6 damage, holy shit] Seamus opens the box, and sees inside a carved wood and bone pendant or talisman of some kind. Next to it is a piece of paper. Aleya gets an unbelievably strong necromantic sense from the pendant. She warns the others that it shouldn't be touched. The box is actually lined with lead.
Aleya and Angelo, through understanding of magic and experience respectively, know that lead can protect from divination magic like scrying. Angelo knows that a shielded item for divination, combined with incredibly powerful necromantic energy, doesn't make sense given the design. But the way it looks, it might be storing something. Seamus can see that the teeth on the amulet look like canines, maybe something as big as a wolf.
Aleya will prioritise the item for Identify. Everyone's gathered around to wait and see. She realises she'd have to touch it to identify it, so she doesn't do that. She takes out the piece of paper, and casts Comprehend Languages as Brande isn't with us. The letter tells Saarvith to take care of the ‘phylactery'. It apparently belongs to the Ghostlord, and Saarvith is told in the letter to keep it safe. The letter is from Ulwai.
Seamus and Angelo both roll Arcana checks. Seamus knows that wizards to obtain a certain level of power and try to attain immortality. They will try to do this by sealing their soul within an object like this phylactery, so that they can never truly die. He read about this in a tome about the creation of items to store souls, kind of like an artificer's take on the subject. He knows that it usually involves giving up a large part of yourself and tearing your soul out of your own body is incredibly risky.  Angelo has read about lichs before, so he knows everything Seamus does, and has read stories about people achieving lichdom. He can't quite remember the name, Lady something. Phylacteries are
usually constructions of wizards, and the design of this doesn't fit with that. This is druidic in design, which is unusual.
We lock the box, putting it away in the Bag of Holding.
Aleya sets about Identifying the other items.
As she does so, Seamus relays everything he knows to the group. Angelo, still opting to wear black instead of his usual blue, only adds to it by saying, ‘Maybe we should just give it back.' He just casually throws that out there and says nothing else.
Ganraz and Seamus debate this, and Ganraz suggests keeping the phylactery as a bargaining chip to get the Ghostlord to work for us. Vilgrim says that might be dangerous. Jhen puts in that it's best to ask the Starsinger for advice, or maybe Itaan.
The other items are: Periapt of Wisdom. Full set of Rhest Plate Armour. The axe is Granite Rend. +1 axe, and you can turn yourself into Korg twice a day. There are 10 flesh-eater arrows total. The two diamond tipped arrows are jaunt arrows, which is how Saarvith teleported across the map. Ring of Water Walking. The red hook arrow is an Arrow of Slaying, which can be specified to a target by the blood of the entity you want to kill. This one is attuned to kill hobgoblins. The pearl Nurkel'Nak was wearing is a Pearl of Power, which gives a free third-level spell slot once a day. We also have 80 platinum and 2500 gold.
Vilgrim gets Saarvith's bow. Seamus takes Granite Rend. Gareth is given the Periapt of Wisdom. Aleya asks if Ganraz wants the armour, but he says she should probably have it. It's the first set of proper armour she's owned. She also holds on to the Pearl of Power. Vilgrim and Brande split the flesh-eater arrows, 5 each. Vilgrim says they should both split the jaunt arrows between the two of them. Brande takes the Ring of Water Walking.
At this moment, Angelo hears a message in his head. It's Itaan's voice. The group have passed through Terrelten, near Nimon Gap. They found out this morning that Drellin's Ferry burned. Angelo replies, that we are indeed alive, and that two of the five Wyrmlords are dead. We've seen three dragons, and we will plan and get back to him. We know that Nimon Gap is good for orchards and the like, so it's not defensible but good for picking up supplies.
Angelo tells the party what he's just learned. There is a dead silence irl, which goes on so long that The Scribe thinks that their discord crashed. Then we process that, and Ganraz asks Angelo to check in one Elaine next time he uses the sending stone. Angelo nods. Aleya asks Angelo if he's ok, because he's not acting like himself. He says yeah, he's fine. She insight checks that. He lyin.

{[h]In the Hall of Ancestors}
Sheyla arrives to take us up the Ancestor Tree. This place is absolutely rammed with people this time. Starsinger Sellyr is standing this time, and we see Ota in the crowd with other druids. Sheyla salutes Sellyr, and then the rest of the clan, and goes to sit with the Talons. All the attention of the entire tribe is on us.
Sellyr says that we have travelled far. It's good to see us return so soon, and that Killiar has told the clan of what they've done. Here they speak for themselves, so we are expected to do the same and explain exactly what we did.
Brande speaks first. He tells her that we destroyed the brood, took out Saarvith and Nurkel'Nak, and encountered the dragon. Ganraz corrects him by saying it's been defeated. Aleya hisses that she's not sure if it counts as being defeated. The clan remain in respectful silence, listening to our account.
Killiar stands and confirms that we did this. He saw Saarvith's body himself, as well as many minions. It appears that the razor fiends have been quelled for a moment. Some of the clan nod, some make the salute gesture back to him.
Sellyr says that this is a great feat, and that we are very capable. She then addresses the whole assembly, saying that Jhen has asked for the clan's help against the Red Hand. She then asks the party if that is our wish as well. We don't need to convince her, but we need to ask this of the people we would hunt alongside. Everyone makes their own decisions here, so she can't tell someone to go to war.
Ganraz steps up. He addresses the Longclaw clan, acknowledging that the people of the Vale have turned a blind eye to their cause for too long. He believes the clan are strong enough to survive without them, but the future where they help to fight against the Red Hand is a better one. We would be grateful if they would help us as we have helped them.
Sheyla backs him up and addresses the Talons. She has hunted alongside us, and what we say is true. She thinks if the denizens of the Vale fall, then the Red Hand will come for us next. Killiar also stands, and pledges his Talons to us as allies. The 8 of them stand and agree.
The NestMaster also stands. He says that he guards these nests to protect the tribe, and if they are best used by protecting the Vale to protect the clan in the long term, he will help us too.
Sellyr says she too will aid us in whatever ways she can, and as she does so roughly 300 Longclaw clan members stand and salute us. We have won about 200 bows, 30 owls, and a group of paladins.
The Starsinger says that we should continue to rest, as she can see we are weary. The clan will need time to plan. Sellyr summons an eagle from a feather, and asks who the lord of Brindal is. Angelo answers. She sends a message with the eagle towards Brindal, letting him know that emissaries of the clan will be visiting soon. Killiar says he will fly to Brindal, and offers to take us with him. We say yes, that would be very good, we didn't want to walk.
As the meeting concludes and people filter out, Sellyr approaches us. She gives us a Feather Token, which Brande takes. She has noticed that we look troubled. Brande and Angelo have absolutely no idea what she's talking about. Ganraz says we're just tired, and asks if we can help out around Starsong Hill at all. Aleya also says that we have something Sellyr might want to take a look at.
As we start to prep for the coming days, we end our session.  `

{[b]Angelo:} We're heading to Brindol, with Longclaw emissary. Inform Lord ir'Jarmaath of this and remind him I'm working with House Cristole. Please check in on Elaine.
Itaan (a few moments later): Elise will write Lord ir'Jarmaath. You have Cristole's backing. Elaine is fine. She may be bearing twins. Anything you want researched by me? Good luck!
Angelo (goes to find Ganraz, and gently taps him on the shoulder to get his attention): …It might be twins.
Ganraz: ……………………………………….Thank you.

{[h]Day 1}
{[u]Context:}
Aleya finds Brande to have a chat about Tina Siorai and what happened with the Dragon.
{[u]Conversation:}
{[b]Aleya:} So, at some point during the two days that we have as downtime, Aleya comes to find Brande. She's not armoured, and it's probably the first proper time Brande has seen her without armour (she still has her spellbook and the lightsaber on her though). She walks up to him: "can I ask you something?"
{[b]Brande:} When Aleya comes to meet Brande in the open area that the Starsinger suggested to him, you find him with his wings of fire out, floating a bit unsteadily about 2/3 meters above the ground. His eyes are closed and he is frowning clearly concentrating quite a bit on something. As Aleya comes up and speaks she startles him a bit causing his flames to flare up and force him upwards fairly quickly. Realising who it is he'll ungracefully come back down and stop concentrating on the wings to make them disperse. Brande look kinda tired; some bags under the eyes etc. In a fairly upbeat tone of voice;
"Hey Aleya, seems like you've finally started relaxing in this time off! What would you like to know?"
{[b]Aleya:} In her usual, deadpan tone, she replies.
"Not relaxing. Seamus is fixing up my new armour and I doubt I need it here. If you know, what actually is Tina Soirei? And what the fuck compelled you to chase after that dragon?
"Also, you been doing this all day?" - slightly puzzled expression
{[b]Brande:} "Ah, I always forget that you do not know the old stories, forgive me for not telling you sooner. How much time do you have? The best way I can explain Tine Síoraí to you is through a story."
{[b]Aleya:} "As much time as it takes."
{[b]Brande:} "Well, come sit." And he'll gesture to a nearby log. He starts a small fire in front of it and takes out his Teasceol (small black flute like instrument he plays through the heat from his hand) and sits beside you:
"I don't know if it flows as well in this language as it does my own, but I'll try my best to make it work." He begins playing a soft tune in the Teasceol and starts telling his story;
In the beginning there was only Tine Síoraí. As all flames do, he created embers that sparked into Tine/flames of their own. The first great Tine was Tine Lontach (the Sun). After Tine Lontach, many more Tine were created, and spread across the sky to far distant lands, creating the stars you see at night.
With one of the last Tine that Tine Síoraí created, he decided to try something different. He surrounded the Tine with the ash and soot and other remnants that had remained over time to create the first Hipoki Tine (covered Tine), which he named Matutine (Creation Tine/Eberron).
Seeing this, Tine Lontach decided that he wanted to create his own Hipoki Tine. Like Tine Síoraí, he surrounded a Tine he created with ash and soot, creating the first Mórtine (moon). Pleased with himself, he decided to create another, and another, until he had created 13 Mórtine. With this, Tine Lontach claimed that clearly he was greater than Tine Síoraí, for he has created many more Tine Hipoki than Tine Síoraí had.
But Tine Lontach had not fully grasped what Tine Síoraí had done, for he had made Matutine have natural grooves and great peaks that would allow for its Tine to occasionally escape from its Hipoki and spread across its surface. The Tine that spread would then be wrapped in new Hipoki, creating new smaller Hipoki Tine of all different varieties. These became the original trees, animals and all forms of life that we see today.
Furious that his creations could not do this themselves, Tine Lontach destroyed one of his Mórtine, which is why there are only 12 left in the sky now. The Tine that was once contained in the Hipoki of the destroyed moon crashed across the land of Matutine, creating vicious Raksa (monsters) which inherited the wrath of Tine Lontach. These Raksa are the hellhounds and other creatures that ravage our lands to this day.
Tine Síoraí was not only angry, but disappointed with Tine Lontach for his rash behaviour, and told him that to atone for his actions, he must find a way to cure Matutine of the Raksa he created, lest they destroy all the life that was flourishing across Matutine. So Tine Lontach taught some of the Hipoke Tine how to use their Tines and the Tines of others to defend themselves, and fight the Raksa. Those he taught were the ancestors of the Kenna. Since then the Kenna have passed down these teachings, allowing them to manipulate their own Tine as well as the Tine of other Tine Hipoki and Matutine itself.
There are also those of each generation who have a strong mastery over these abilities, and learn to use the Tine of one of the Mórtine or even of Tine Lontach to bolster their ability. They are given titles to match their abilities. Brande's father is a Tine Lontach, and a childhood friend of his is a Mórtine.
{[b]Aleya:} "So it's your God. And it gives you your abilities?"
{[b]Brande:} "In short yes, though what Tine Síoraí has gifted me is more than any other of my tribe. He has spoken to me directly and given me visions. He has granted me the abilities you have seen me use in combat." At this point he summons his bow "As well as this blessing. I believe that he has granted me a small part of his Tine and from this is where these powers stem."
{[b]Aleya:} "And when he speaks to you, what does he look like?"
{[b]Brande:} "I can't say I have ever seen his form, only a voice and visions that he has shown me. The closest I could say would be the first vision that he showed me, of the endless sea of fire and the blinding bright flames."
"This also brings me to your second question - why I went after the black dragon. When the dragon first came down I was terrified. All I could think to do was to get away from it as quick as possible."
"And that is what I did at first - I ran as fast as I could, even using some of the techniques my people taught me to get away faster"
"But as I was running, it was almost as if I could feel my Tine inside me growing, and crackling, trying to burst out of me. I felt an anger that I cannot say I have ever felt towards any being as I felt towards that dragon. And that anger grew well past the fear that had made me run"
"Before I knew it I was firing at the dragon, flying towards it just thinking that it had to die, that such an abomination could not be allowed to continue to exist."
"I believe that this came about for the same reason that I could not become a Mórtine - I do not have enough control. Over my own Tine or Tine Síoraí's. I let the fire grow more than it should have, burning me and those around me. I'm just glad that I didn't cause any further harm to the rest of you."
After saying that he'll be quiet for a bit before saying in a cheerier voice;
"But that's why I'm here. I need to learn to control that flame, and the only way I know how is practice and training."
{[b]Aleya:} "Unless I'm wrong, you don't really know that your abilities actually come from Tine Siorai. You seem like a decent guy, and you're certainly not bad in a fight, but you wouldn't be the first to be manipulated by some weird shit."
"How long have the Kenna been around?"
"The way all this is going I admit I'm not comfortable with, it's well past what I'm used to."
"I want to understand what we can actually do, and I need to be sure that those around me aren't going to make stupid decisions that end up getting us all killed"
"What you did in chasing the dragon was probably the stupidest fucking thing I've seen, and I've seen a lot of shit. Yeah, we all got out of it ok, but I don't like our chances for next time."
"Are you sure you can control whatever it is that made you feel that way? I can see that you're trying, but you need to be goddamn certain."
{[b]Brande:} "I'm sure it is Tine Síoraí, or at least one of his embers. My father had told me this was a blessing from him. What else could have granted me these abilities, these visions? I've never heard of any Raksa or creature that could do such a thing."
"The Kenna have been around since they were created by Matutine - were you not listening to the story I just told, or did I just fail to translate it properly?" At this point Brande would be getting visibly frustrated/angry
"Yes this is much more than I expected when Tine Síoraí first gave me the visions of the caravan, but this is a journey that he wants us to complete. He has chosen us as the ones to defeat the betrayer."
"I want to gain an understanding and control over these powers just as you want me too. I do not want to bring any harm to any of our group or to those who do not deserve it."
He takes a deep breath, exhales and pauses for a moment before continuing in a calmer tone;
"Yes, chasing that dragon was not a good decision. It almost cost me my life if it wasn't for Seamus and Gareth. But that is why I need to spend this time here. I need to control it so it doesn't get the better of me."
"Tine Síoraí gave me this blessing for a reason, and he believes I can control this power as well so long as I have patience."
At that he will sit back down on the log, summon his bow and take out a knife. He slowly and carefully starts to try and carve some symbols into the still smoldering wood. He pushes a bit too hard and nicks himself with the blade, which he curses at.
He'll dispel his bow with a sigh and say "I will control these powers, but even if I can't in these few days, I still have the training of my people you can rely on. That will not falter."
{[b]Aleya:} "My point is that we're going up against a very powerful entity with aims and goals beyond our understanding. I would not put it past this Tiamat to have plans thousands of years in the making."
"I get what you're saying, but your people don't seem the type to keep track of how many years have passed exactly. If Angelo is right and Tiamat was around millions of years ago everything can get so messed up"
"Just cos' you haven't heard of something doesn't mean it can't happen"
"I don't know shit about any of this, so I have to go off what you said. But that doesn't mean I'm comfortable about it"
"If you think you can master whatever you're being given then so be it, but if you lose control and threaten others then I will put you down if I need to"
"I don't want it to come to that, so if you need help or whatever then just ask. I probably can't help much, but the offer is there"
"Until then, take this". Aleya holds out the Pearl of Power. "It should help you get the most out of whatever shit Tina Siorai is giving you."
{[b]Brande:} Brande will take it saying;
"Thank you, I will try to use this to the best of my ability."
"And I appreciate your offer, if I think of anything I will let you know. There are many things that cannot be done on your own."
"It's a strangely comforting dealing knowing that if things do go out of control that I know there is someone who will quench the flames, but know that the same applies to you. If you were to do something that caused harm against our group or the others of our cause, I would not hesitate to take you down if that is the necessary course of action."
"Additionally, for all I know you could be another one of those 'Mr Flay' Raksa. I understand that these are times where you can't trust everyone at face value. Though if there is one thing I know, it's that actions speak a lot more than words to a person's true self."
"I hope that my actions going forward will give you more trust in me and my people."
"Though one thing I will leave you with. Do not go insulting that which you do not understand." He will take out one of his black glass tipped scimitars.
He flips it round so he is holding the blade end with the handle facing you
{[b]Aleya:} "A challenge, really?"
{[b]Brande:} "It's not a challenge, just have a look at my blade"
"Though if you don't trust me enough to take it, I can just show you here."
{[b]Aleya:} "No, it's fine. Just not used to people handing me weapons without also trying to kill me"
Aleya takes the offered weapon
{[b]Brande:} "You have odd customs."
{[b]Aleya:} "Not a custom, just what I'm used to"
{[b]Brande:} Inspecting the blade, you see a number of different ruins and shapes carved into it. Some overlapping, some branching off of others and some out on their own. You would estimate there's over a hundred different runes on each side (they are quite small)
"Each of those symbols there is something new created by a generation of my ancestors. It is a legacy of theirs that passes down to help those that come after."
"Through these we grow, just as a small spark can spread into a great roaring flame, the experience and knowledge of those that came before me are also with me."
"We are a people who exist to protect what Tine Síoraí has given us from those that wish for it to be destroyed. To protect Matutine from the Raksa that Tine Lontach rained down upon us."
"I intend to continue this, and to help pass some of these powers that Tine Síoraí has blessed me with to those who come after me."
He'll summon the bow and hand it to Aleya
{[b]Aleya:} "Well, if I can help keep you alive so you can do that then I will. For better or for worse, we're all in the same shitty situation."
"At least you were expecting it a bit"
{[b]Brande:} It's warm to the touch, still has the look and feel of a log that was just on a fire with the red/orange veins running through it
He'll point his finger at different point allow the bow, where you can see some of the runes that you saw on the scimitar he showed you earlier
"I will learn to use this power, and pass it on to those who come after me. If their trials are anything like we have faced, they will need all the help they can get."
He'll walk back to the log and the bow will dissipate into smoke, before reforming in his lap where he starts working on carving the runes in again
"If you have any more questions about me or my people, feel free to ask them. Hopefully they will eliminate some of your worries, or at least help you understand more."
{[b]Aleya:} "Well, I won't pretend I understand, or like it fully, but you seem to know what you're doing and I'll take that right now."
You would probably notice that Aleya has looked slightly uneasy throughout the whole conversation and since the morning after we got back from Rhest
{[b]Brande:} "Here, come sit with me by the fire. A proper conversation needs warmth, light and food" He'll offer a piece of deer he caught earlier and cooked on the fire
"Though there is something I would like to ask you. Where, or more likely what have you come from that has grown such a mistrust?"
{[b]Aleya:} When you ask her your question she scowls slightly. "Maybe I'll tell you one day, but not now."
She will sit though, and take some of the offered deer
{[b]Brande:} "That's fine. I have started to come to understand that many are not as open as my people. The world is a bigger place that there is much to learn from."
"Oh, and I'm sorry I don't have the drink you all seem to like so much - I still can't stand the taste."
{[b]Aleya:} She laughs a bit "The taste isn't really the point"
"But whatever you're comfortable with"
{[b]Brande:} "I prefer drinks that allow me to keep wits about me, and don't give me a sharp pain in the morning."
"But more so I prefer food - what you can catch here is much nicer than anything I have experienced at home."
{[b]Aleya:} "Losing your wits is the main part. There is some stuff that tastes better. I'll get you some in Brindel if you want."
"Never really thought about it, but I've always been in similar places"
{[b]Brande:} "If you say so. So long as it tastes better, and we know that we have some time to recover, I'll take you up on that."
"You should try traveling, it does help you to see the world in a different light. Perhaps I can take you to see my people at some point. I'm sure they would be interested in the stories you have to tell of the lands they haven't seen before."
{[b]Aleya:} "Maybe, just never had the time. Fighting a war does limit things"
{[b]Brande:} "Ah, the war that I keep hearing about. I'm assuming also the one I saw in my visions. What would cause so many to fight at such a scale? Why fight amongst your own people? What could you have to gain over all of that. Was it a case similar to what we are doing, where one group of Raksa and others were out attempting to ransack the lands?"
"I've tried asking Seamus before, but he would always brush off the question, saying he either didn't want to talk about it or that I don't need to know."
{[b]Aleya:} "I, err, think it started because the ruling family were arguing amongst themselves. Not too sure. But from as early as I can remember the war was going."
"I won't say I particularly want to talk about it either. But some of the things I've seen were truly horrifying."
{[b]Brande:} "How could a family argument cause so much fighting. Why would so many give their lives over such a trivial matter. Who are these people that so many would do things that even you feel are too horrible to repeat?"
{[b]Aleya:} "People fight for money, or love, or just because there's nothing better to do. I'm no different. The family just happened to be the ones in charge of everything. Then once it started it just couldn't be stopped."
{[b]Brande:} "That makes more sense when you explain it like that. All I seem to hear are bits of those who gave their lives in a valiant effort for some person they have never even seen. It seems that it is just an excuse some use to excuse their actions."
"It is nice to have someone who knows what's going on that will actually speak directly without dancing around a subject. There are to many of those people here."
{[b]Aleya:} "I need some excuse. I won't pretend that I'm any better."
"You can rely on me for that, never liked liars."
{[b]Brande:} "At least you are honest about that."
{[b]Aleya:} "No reason not to be. I'm not proud of it, but I did it anyway. For all the smiles and shit though I would bet money on the others being similar"
{[b]Brande:} Brande would probably just sit there quietly for a while carving the runes, occasionally lighting the flame in his hand and holding it under one's he has carved causing them to glow a brighter orange that doesn't fade when he removes the flame.
"You're more than welcome to spend some time here if you wish. It's quite peaceful here. It's a nice change of pace with everything that's been going on."
"So long as you don't mind me working or occasionally creating wings of fire. I still don't think I'm fully used to them."
{[b]Aleya:} "I might take you up on that. I could use a bit of a rest. As long as they don't come too close to me, I don't mind. Bit wary of fire."
{[b]Brande:} "Haha, and yet you have stuck with me through all this! Don't worry, I looked for a place like this for a reason, I will keep my distance and there should be no fear of it spreading."
{[b]Aleya:} "Thanks. It's more when it's a bit too close. I appreciate it all the same."
Aleya at this point will take out her spellbook, some ink and a quill and start trying to decipher some more stuff
{[b]Brande:} Depending on how long Aleya sticks around, Brande will keep on working on his bow for around an hour, before standing up and walking towards the center of the clearing. He holds out his bow, and mutters "Rise" to himself, the wings of fire unfurling from his back.
He won't move at first, just stands there looking over the wings, stretching them out a little and shrinking the fire down from the normal size. He then rises slowly in the air, still unsteady on his feet, drifting left and right a bit before slowing it down to a point where he is basically hovering in one spot.
He takes a breath, holds his bow steady, and starts doing precise shots at a nearby tree. He then slowly moves to a different position and makes a few more shots.
After a couple more cycles of that, he starts to slowly move at different paces, taking shots as he does so. While he's moving like this he does miss much more.
{[b]Aleya:} Seeing this, Aleya pipes up saying "You should probably focus on getting comfortable with the wings and flying before trying anything else. You need the foundation."
{[b]Brande:} "You may be right there, though I must admit I'm still not comfortable with flying. I feel that I don't worry about it as much if I focus on firing my bow."
{[b]Aleya:} "Then focus on merely staying in the air"
{[b]Brande:} Brande sighs deeply and dispelled his bow. He lowers himself and just tries floating a few meters of the ground, trying to keep in one spot. Odd little fluctuations make him jut forward every now and then but he mostly stays in place
"H-Hows this" focusing more on keeping in place than talking
{[b]Aleya:} "Better, now do that until you can stay consistently in the same place. If you can't talk, then you won't be able to shoot anything."
"It's exactly the same as learning about the arcane. Sure you want to be able to cause explosions and shit, but if you neglect the basics then you're just going to end up killing yourself."
{[b]Brande:} He'll lower himself back down to the ground for the moment, letting the wings die down to a small smoulder
"You remind me of my mentor while I was training to become an Atutine."
{[b]Aleya:} "As long as it helps. I had a good teacher, and I guess I just picked some stuff up."
{[b]Brande:} "Well it worked then I'm sure it will now, though at least now I'm not as stubborn as I was then. Thanks for the advice."
He takes out his scimitar and marks a cross on the ground at his feet. The wings grow again to their previous size and he rises back up, this time looking down at the cross and trying to keep it in the same position
{[b]Aleya:} "Do it every day for as long as you can manage. Once you've managed that then move around slowly focussing on stability."
{[b]Brande:} He'll look up, nod, then continue back looking at the cross.
{[b]Aleya:} After a couple of minutes of that happening, Aleya gets up and uses minor illusion to make a vaguely draconic roar.
{[b]Brande:} He jolts forward away from the sound, summons his bow and turns around
He sees you performing the actions for the spell, and curses at you in his language
{[b]Aleya:} "Maintain your concentration. And your temper. If you were 500ft up you'd now be dead."
"If you can't do this in combat then it's nothing more than an interesting trick"
{[b]Brande:} He lands, and says, "That was a shitty thing to do after saying to focus on fundamentals. Perhaps you're more like Sioné then my mentor."
{[b]Aleya:} "You need to be able to maintain the fundamentals in any situation. Life isn't fair."
"Anyway, it was useful to see how you react to things."
{[b]Brande:} "I should've known from the start you'd be testing me."
{[b]Aleya:} "Be thankful that I didn't hit you. It won't work again now anyway because you'll be expecting it."
{[b]Brande:} "I'll be honest I was more expecting you to try striking me than perform tricks, didn't quite seem like your style."
{[b]Aleya:} "The latter seemed to be enough this time. We don't want a repeat of what happened with that Dragon."
{[b]Brande:} "If I knew any better I would think you're provoking me. If there's something you are trying to trigger I don't think it's going to go as you expect."
{[b]Aleya:} "You misunderstand. I'm trying to make it so that you can maintain your concentration in any situation. It's going to be fuck all use if you let things get the better of you and fall or can't summon them in the first place."
"You know that combat is both terrifying and distracting. You've never been in a pitched battle. You don't know what it's like when people you've known for years get ripped apart or have the eyes burnt out their skull. The screams and fear in everyone's eyes. The smell of blood and shit. You need to be able to control this."
{[b]Brande:} Brande will stare at Aleya for a while
He'll then go into a more relaxed stance, and take a big sigh. "Alright."
"I'm pretty sure I can reignite my wings one more time before I need to spend some time recovering my energy. The longest I've managed to keep them out is about 10 minutes without distraction. Let's see if I can get to that with a distraction."
He'll cast fly again, and start floating over the cross, facing away from you
{[b]Aleya:} After about 7 minutes or so, Aleya reaches into her component pouch and pulls out a handful of multicoloured sand and throws it in the air in front of Brande (She casts colour spray and for RP sake we'll presume I rolled high enough). Brande finds himself unable to see.
{[b]Brande:} He would still try to keep himself in position, but would instinctively go to his eyes, attempting to clear them. As they don't clear he'll take a deep breath, close his eyes and just try to focus.
Without the visual aid however, he would start to drift off the cross, and probably to rise up a bit as well.
{[b]Aleya:} He finds it wears off pretty quickly. "Better, but you've moved around too much. Enough for today. Do it again tomorrow, even if I'm not here."
{[b]Brande:} "Give me an hour or so and I'll be up again, I think I might start practicing with my eyes closed. Stop relying too much on one sense."
{[b]Aleya:} "A good idea." Working on the basis that it's getting kinda late (in game). "I'm going to head back though. Do you want anything from the room or market?"
{[b]Brande:} "No that's alright, I've caught any food I need for these days and I have the equipment I need. Just let the others know that I'm alright. Wouldn't want them to worry."
{[b]Aleya:} "Will do. Try not to catch a cold out here." Aleya gets up and leaves, Lakrith comes and sits on her shoulder and she gives it a little stroke as she walks away.
{[b]Brande:} "Thanks for checking on me, and thanks for the advice" he'll call out as she's leaving

{[u]Context:}
Aleya seeks out Angelo's advice about Brande's behaviour, but Angelo is still not really present. It gets deep. They're basically best friends now, right Nick?
{[u]Conversation:}
(at some point after the conversation with Brande, Aleya walks up to Angelo when he's not busy. Angelo is sitting by the window, looking out over Starsong Hill)
{[b]Aleya:} Are there any people in stories similar to Brande? As in, people who have been granted abilities by some deity or something?
{[b]Angelo:} (it takes him a second to register what she said) You mean, like in old legends? Heroes chosen by prophecies and such? If you ask any cleric of the Silver Flame, they'll all tell you they were chosen by a higher power and have been gifted their abilities by their belief.
{[b]Aleya:} In anything really, and not necessarily purely by belief, like as if to help with a specific task or something.
{[b]Angelo:} (thinks about it for a second) I can think of Silver Flame stories. Priests being given holy tasks and whatnot. The only other stories I can remember are usually horror stories. Casters who can bend the mind, that sort of thing.
{[b]Aleya:} I ask cos' not even Brande is actually sure what Tine Siorai actually is. I don't like the idea of being a plaything for some entity and none of this sits well with me, it's too far gone from just being about hobgoblins now. Anyway, you don't seem to be holding up all that great. This about what happened in Rhest?
{[b]Angelo:} (looks pretty pale, and now he doesn't meet her gaze. His hand goes to his locket, and he seems to calm down) It's fine. Just tired. Brande doesn't know what Tine Siorai is? Isn't it his fire god or something?
{[b]Aleya:} Motherfucking insight check on the 'just fine'. 23.
{[b]Angelo:} 16 for deception. Fuck. Even my +10 couldn't save me.
{[b]Aleya:} He knows it's his fire god, but not actually any more than that, which is the part that worries me.
{[b]Angelo:} So... you think Tine Siorai is taking advantage of him?
{[b]Aleya:} Maybe, maybe not. I just think that Tine Siorai may not actually be what he thinks it is. He's a decent person, but naive, and pretty easily manipulated.
{[b]Angelo:} (trying to concentrate) Ok. I can see what you mean. If Brande believes everything's fine then he won't look for danger. So, if we say Tine Siorai is... what? A caster? What do you want to do?
{[b]Aleya:} At the moment, nothing. There's nothing I can do except try to help Brande master his abilities. (She sits down next to Angelo) Also, that was a terrible lie. You want to tell me what's going on?
{[b]Angelo:} (looking a little vacant again, and his hand goes back to idly fidgeting with the locket around his neck) I... I'll be ok. I'm already better than I was yesterday. I'm just... For a moment I was... (he kind of shakes it off) What about you? How are you feeling? Nurkel'Nak was a nasty piece of work.
{[b]Aleya:} Don't try to deflect back to me. You're no use to anyone like this. Was it the near death experience or something else? And what's that locket? It clearly has value for you.
{[b]Angelo:} (raises an eyebrow, and for a second it's like the Angelo she knows is fully back in the room. He even sounds more like himself again as he answers) It's not like people think I'm much use on a regular basis, is it?
{[b]Aleya:} I wouldn't say that. I can't say I really understand what you do, but if the blood coming out of goblin noses after you speak is any indication then you're clearly doing something right.
{[b]Angelo:} (There is a long pause as he tries to focus and gather himself) You know I am from Cyre, yes? Or, was. There is no Cyre now. This is the only important thing I have left. (He grips the locket a bit tighter, until his knuckles go white, and his voice drops to something very small and quiet) In Rhest, when... When I was... It made me remember things.
Aleya is silent, just letting him speak. Eyes watching relatively intently
{[b]Angelo:} I don't want to talk about that. You're right, I'm no good to anyone if I'm... back to how I was. I made a promise. I have something I need to do. Can't do anything if I'm back on the border, can I? But Rhest made me remember. I thought I was dead, you know. It probably sounds stupid. But I thought I was dead, and I woke up at the bottom of a lake, and it was like dying all over again. Drowning. And although instinct made me panic and try to swim, I didn't really... feel it. I didn't feel anything. (He runs his hands through his hair) Ancestors give me strength, I sound like a madman. Forget it.
{[b]Aleya:} Were you... in Cyre when it happened?
{[b]Angelo:} I... No, I wasn't. But I tried.... Someone I... No. I wasn't in Cyre when it happened.
{[b]Aleya:} Trust me, I know how you feel. I thought I had died once, and in a lot of ways I wish that I had died then. But every time it goes badly, it brings me back to that same moment. It never goes away.
That locket, I presume it belonged to someone important to you?
{[b]Angelo:} It used to connect me to someone. Through magic. It was stupid to ask you if it still had magic in it. I knew it didn't. It was a foolish thing to hope for.
{[b]Aleya:} You're doing more than enough with us. Without you I certainly wouldn't be here now, and I can't really repay that. You can't do any more than what you're capable of anyway. Hope isn't foolish, and you had no way of knowing.
{[b]Angelo:} (He looks at her, and for a second he's completely focused, like he's decided something. There's a soft whirl of arcane energy as three silver butterflies manifest around him. He doesn't smile, so he's not fully back to himself, but he looks more like Angelo than he did five minutes ago. When he speaks, it's mostly to himself) I think I know how to help.
{[b]Aleya:} There you go then. Whatever it was, and I won't pry, but use it as a source of strength. That way it will keep you going even if you don't feel like it.
{[b]Angelo:} (smiling faintly) That's exactly what it's for. I haven't been myself lately, and I apologise. I'm working on it. Like I said, I will be fine. I've been here before, I can come back again.
Now, what about you?
{[b]Aleya:} I won't pretend I'm not shaken up by the fact that this is now well beyond what I'm comfortable with. Hobgoblins are fine. Dragons and millennia old entities can fuck off. Amazed that we all got out of Rhest. And the phylactery or whatever doesn't fill me with joy. Apart from that I'm the same Aleya that you've always known.
{[b]Angelo:} Glad to hear it. Against my better judgement, I'm getting used to having you around. Scathing sarcasm and all. And the dragons and millennia old entities can definitely fuck off.
{[b]Aleya:} I mean, you'd think, after millennia they would've just given up.
{[b]Angelo:} It's just downright rude. We're trying to mind our own business and they have to barge in like this.
{[b]Aleya:} It's like they don't think we have better things to do. Fucking bastards.
{[b]Angelo:} (laughing lightly, and then his smile fades into something more serious) Ah, Aleya? Please just... forget everything I said. I was rambling, I said more than I would have if I'd been in my right mind. I'm not normally one for oversharing.
{[b]Aleya:} I shall do my best to. Not my business anyway.
{[b]Angelo:} I have no guarantee of that, but I'll take you at your word. One thing I don't mind you remembering is that I made a promise to be better than I was. And I may have something to help us prepare for future "adventures". I'll think on it. I still feel... numb, I suppose is the best way to describe it. But I've remembered something important, and that's a good start. In the meantime, if you have anything else you need of me, now is the best time to ask whilst I'm still lucid.
{[b]Aleya:} I can remember that. Don't judge yourself too harshly, you don't need to be stupid and end up killing yourself - we have Brande for that.
Angelo looks very confused.
{[b]Aleya:} Oh, you missed that didn't you. Brande chased after the dragon and almost died.
{[b]Angelo:} He... ok. Wow.
{[b]Aleya:} If there's nothing else I can do for you?
{[b]Angelo:} I don't think I need anything. If you want to repay me though, maybe you could answer some questions about yourself at some point. (He grins, and now he definitely looks more like himself) Just keep being your beautiful self. Also, do you think I should stick with black? I think it suits me, don't you?
{[b]Aleya:} Well, it doesn't make me want to murder you, and is slightly more practical than the blue.
{[b]Angelo:} Ah, so you don't want to kill me anymore, that's good. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were getting used to having me around.
{[b]Aleya:} Keep asking me for clothing advice and that might change. (He smirks at that answer)
I don't suppose you have any amethyst on you?
{[b]Angelo:} My locket is really my only jewellery. I don't think I have any, sorry. Is it for a spell?
{[b]Aleya:} I think so, not entirely sure. It's... difficult to translate.
{[b]Angelo:} Translate? Oh, your book? What language is it in?
{[b]Aleya:} It's not in any particular language. More a code.
{[b]Angelo:} Interesting. Maybe I can help, if you need it. Don't know how much use I am to you, but the offer is there.
{[b]Aleya:} Thanks, but I'd rather keep it to myself.
{[b]Angelo:} Fair enough, I wasn't trying to pry. If you need me for anything else, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be... around. I need to think about some things.
{[b]Aleya:} I'll be here. At least until I fall asleep. The last few days have been fucking exhausting.
{[b]Angelo:} They certainly have... Goodnight Aleya.

{[h]Day 2}
{[u]Context:}
After some in-session things have occurred, Angelo, now more like himself, finds it unusual that Brande isn't with the party. He goes down to the training ground to talk to him (and it's kind of gay)
{[u]Conversation:}
(As Angelo comes to the clearing, Brande would be sitting on a log with a small fire in front of it, working on his bow with a small knife. Around the clearing would be a few noticeable scorch marks, but nothing too large)
{[b]Angelo:} What are you doing over here by yourself?
{[b]Brande:} Hey Angelo, did Aleya not say? No, I suppose she wouldn't. With everything that has happened I have realised that I need to spend more time training and understanding the powers that Tine Síoraí has granted me. At the moment I do not have enough control over a flame such as his, and so I wish to practice somewhere I cannot put others in harm's way.
{[b]Angelo:} (sits next to him on the log) No, of course she didn't. Aleya's not one for sharing, and it's me. I was, uh, out of the fight for a while, so I didn't actually see what happened. When I surfaced, you were falling. You don't have to talk about it, if you don't want to. But I haven't really been... present, for a little while, so I'm a little out of the loop, as it were.
{[b]Brande:} That's alright, that fight took a larger toll on all of us than I think any of us expected. And in a way, I was somewhat out of the fight myself. I heard from the others that you were struck hard yourself - I'm sorry I wasn't able to help more. I would rather talk through these things. I find the perspective of others is important in these matters, and may help with my training. I may as well explain what happened from my perspective. During the fight, when the dragon first arrived, I felt a fear stronger than anything I have ever felt before. Whether this was due to my past experience on the bridge or otherwise I don't know. All I know is that I needed to get away from that creature as quick as I possibly could. That was my first mistake. From this fear I ran from all of you, and I abandoned you. For that I am sorry.
{[b]Angelo:} (waves his apology off) You have nothing to be sorry for. It was a dragon, Brande, and I know you can't swim. I would rather you run for the boats so that you can live, than run into a dragon's jaws pointlessly. Fear is... normal. If you're worried about it, then rest assured I'm not angry at you. I doubt the others will give you a bollocking either, everyone was under pressure. I'm really not good with the whole... emotions, talking, whatever, but I'm glad you're alive. As long as you don't start levitating in the guest lodges again and burn the tree down. Then I might get pissed off at you.
{[b]Brande:} (chuckles) Don't worry, I'm not looking for consolation, I'm merely reflecting on the fight. Fear is survival. It's something that every creature has. I'm well aware of that. It's how I acted under the fear that I need to improve on. It seems that Tine Síoraí thinks this as well, as while I was running, it was almost as if I could feel my Tine inside me growing, and crackling, trying to burst out of me. I felt an anger that I cannot say I have ever felt towards any being as I felt towards that dragon. And that anger grew well past the fear that had made me run. From there it's all a bit hazy. I just remember a deep desire that I needed to take down the dragon, and how it should not be allowed to exist. As when I was first learning to use my Tine, I have a strong flame, but it burns too hot and I have little control over it. So, I must train, and learn to tame it, understand what Tine Síoraí has given me as I have come to understand the Tine I was born with. Hence why I came here, and why I have been practicing both what I have been gifted and applying what I already have learned (gestures to the new runes on his bow).
{[b]Angelo:} (thinking it over) I can understand some of that. I think magic is something that comes from within, and at first it is hard when you gain new powers. I remember when I first learned I had magic, and when it surfaced it was an uncontrolled wave of energy. And I may not know much about Tine Síoraí, and your flame, but... I agree that charging a dragon isn't the smartest plan.
{[b]Brande:} (laughing) Aleya said the same thing, but nowhere near as kindly as you did. As always you are good with your words.
{[b]Angelo:} She means well, our Aleya, but yes, I imagine she was more blunt than I. In regards to your training, I don't know if I can help you in any way, really, I'm not a teacher, but I believe magic is a limb. Your bow is not part of your arm, it's your tool. Your arm is doing the work. The same goes for your magic, it's part of you, so even when you aren't consciously choosing to use it, it will still act according to your emotions, your fears, your adrenaline. Just... I guess what I'm trying to say is, it's ok to not be sure of yourself, particularly in regards to magic. It's bloody magic, it's different for everyone and it can do weird shit. But I think practicing is good, and next time I'm sure you will have more control. That's all casting is really, it's a battle of will.
{[b]Brande:} You have an interesting take on it. For me and my people, what you call magic is a way of extending our Tine - our soul to perform different techniques. In the same way that you can move your limbs to move, to fight, to dance or your voice to speak, sing or tell stories, you can use your Tine to create something new. (He holds out his scimitar where you can see the runes carved into it. At a glance there seems to be over a hundred or so different ones carved around the blade, overlapping and interweaving with each other. His hand warms up, and the runes start to glow orange. He'll pick up a chunky piece of wood, throw it up and slice through it. The runes then fade back to the dark black they once were) My ancestors have shown us many techniques, some which you have seen me use before. Some such as this allow you to channel your Tine into other items, to implant your will onto them. This one is especially good at cutting.
{[b]Angelo:} (idly fiddling with his locket - it's the first time Brande's seen it. It's all silver, with a swirling pattern around the edges, and a dark feather in the centre. It's not clear from this distance if it's a quill like Angelo uses or a raven feather) An extension of the soul… (His hand falls still) That's a nice thought. (He snaps out of his momentary haze) The runes on your bow then... Helps with shooting, I suppose?
{[b]Brande:} The ones I am carving at the moment yes. They can help guide your arrow to its target, and I'm also planning on adding some that will help it to hit harder. I'm hoping that I may also develop some that may help with the abilities that Tine Síoraí has granted me, though I can't say I can think of any at the moment.
{[b]Angelo:} That sounds useful. I don't really have anything like that, all my spells are developed through my personal practice and experimenting. Having runes to help sounds like a very good advantage.
{[b]Brande:} If you would like you can practice with one of my scimitars, I can't say how well it would work though as it has been made to work with our Tine's and I don't believe you are able to produce yours?
{[b]Angelo:} Fire like yours? I don't know, I haven't tried. I think my magic manifests very differently. (He smiles slightly) Perhaps my soul isn't as heroic as yours, oh Chosen One.
{[b]Brande:} (chuckling) You know that Tine Síoraí chose you as well.
{[b]Angelo:} I'm far better served for distracting people or disrupting enemies' attacks, so that strong heroes like yourself, Ganraz or Aleya can get in and win the damn fight. Compared to the rest, I'm hardly noteworthy.
{[b]Brande:} Though from what happened in the last fight, I don't think that's quite so accurate. Saarvith came after you first. I don't think you hold yourself in high enough regard. And if more are coming after you like that, it may be useful for you to learn how to deal with someone at close range.
{[b]Angelo:} I have ways, don't worry. And if it's really going badly, I have all of you big strong warriors around to keep me safe. I think even Aleya hates me a little less than she used to, so I stand a chance of surviving in battle. (He goes quiet for a moment, thinking about what Brande said, and then casts Spirit Guardians. Only three butterflies appear this time, and one lands on his finger) If this is my soul, then my magic has a cold light, I think. Remote, distant. I suppose that's accurate. (He focuses again on Brande) I have a few tricks up my sleeve. When pushed to do so, I can defend myself, don't worry.
{[b]Brande:} I must say, this is a new one on me. You have quite the beautiful Tine, it seems. A lot less hard and practical compared to many others I have seen.
{[b]Angelo:} (snorts) "Less practical". Yes, I'm sure the others think the same. I didn't exactly choose the shape.
{[b]Brande:} You may laugh at it, but this world is more than just practicality. Not everything has to serve just to cut, or burn. Creatures are more than just practicality as well. We have emotions that influence us and our Tine, as you said yourself. (As he's saying this, he will use minor illusion and Prestidigitation to cause the fire to start spitting out small little fires that north into small little firefly like creatures, Prestidigitation adding some warmth to the illusions as they follow around the butterflies)
{[b]Angelo:} Hmm... well, I suppose they did kill Saarvith. And why not look fabulous whilst doing so?
{[b]Brande:} You killed Saarvith with these...? (Looks slightly worried about getting close to them)
{[b]Angelo:} Yes. Mostly by accident. He basically walked into my spell. But keep that between us, otherwise I don't look as cool. They're completely harmless to you and I though. (To prove a point he shows the butterfly perched on his finger, and then holds out a hand to draw the other two closer, so one can land on Brande if he doesn't mind)
{[b]Brande:} (He'll be cautious at first, but he trusts Angelo and will let it land on him) Huh. It seems you have found a way to join emotion and practicality. I'm sorry to say I didn't fully comprehend your ability before. It seems you have a much better grasp over your Tine then I. Perhaps there is more I can learn from your techniques, most of what I know is based around what my people have taught me.
{[b]Angelo:} (shrugs) I can hardly blame you. My magic is a subtle creature, so it probably looks like I don't do much on the battlefield. My speciality is illusions and distraction, channelling focus, that sort of thing. I'm not the best at teaching, but I guess I can try and help with what I do know, if you need me to. Perhaps you, Aleya and I could have a magical training session some time. I'm sure that'll end well.
{[b]Brande:} That certainly could be interesting, though it seems that Aleya is still learning her magic, and I'd be slightly worried that she would get frustrated and bring out her sword... Don't tell her I said that.
{[b]Angelo:} If we hide the sword beforehand, we stand a better chance of surviving the encounter.
{[b]Brande:} Yes, though the issue is is that I don't think she ever leaves the sword - I mean, my bow is bound to my Tine and I still think that she is more attached to her sword. I think that would have to be a job for Vilgrim, I feel he's the only one who might be able to take it from her.
{[b]Angelo:} (thinks for a second, and then grins) I would love to see that. Although we might end up with one less gnome.
{[b]Brande:} (he grins back) I don't know, Vilgrim's pretty good at hiding. I honestly wasn't sure if he was just an illusion when we were originally traveling together.
{[b]Angelo:} He does just vanish into the night, doesn't he? In any case, I doubt we could pay him enough to steal from her. I really wish he would though. Maybe not in Starsong Hill though, this place is beautiful and I would hate to see it destroyed by Aleya's wrath.
{[b]Brande:} Dragons are one thing, but Aleya's wrath is another. Perhaps something we can try once this red hand is dealt with, and we can find somewhere better.
{[b]Angelo:} (laughs at that, and there's a lot more colour in his face now, he looked pretty pale when he first walked into the training area) Ah damn, now you've given me more work to do. Swimming lessons AND arcane training. Plus I have to fight a cult? I didn't sign up for this. Unbelievable. (He sounds much more like himself)
{[b]Brande:} (also look cheerier than when Angelo first entered - before he had a lot more serious expression on and slight bags under his eyes. He's got his smile back and looking more energetic as well) Sorry to keep piling that on you, though I'm sure given time I'll pay you back. Perhaps I'll show you how to make some runes of your own, or how to shoot a bow when you get tired of using your Tine all the time.
{[b]Angelo:} I'll take the runes, I already know I'm no good with a bow. A crossbow, sure, but I doubt I could draw a bow like yours. I am but a weak, slender singer. The rapier suits me just fine. (He looks at his butterflies whilst he's thinking, and then it looks like he decides something) Perhaps I do need to refocus. I've been using my magic in a very scattered manner recently, trying to use it everywhere at once... perhaps I need to concentrate it to certain areas. Food for thought. (He grins) And if you need a way to learn to use your new powers... perhaps you could ask Killiar for flying lessons?
{[b]Brande:} Perhaps, though I don't know how well it'll translate. It may be easier asking the owls. I think first I need to become comfortable with flying. As I discussed with Aleya, I should focus on the fundamentals before I start going any further.
{[b]Angelo:} Oh, you already talked about practice with Aleya? I imagine she'd be a stricter teacher than me. Perhaps we should all sit down and have a talk about magic and training, if we're all going to be stuck together anyway to fight this cult. Team spirit, and all that.
{[b]Brande:} Ha, I don't think you'll like Aleya's methods, she's more than just strict.
{[b]Angelo:} (looks at the scorch marks on the ground) Oh. Well then. Did you two have a fight, or…?
{[b]Brande:} Less of a fight, more combat practice.
{[b]Angelo:} I see. And how did that go? Did it help?
{[b]Brande:} Well, it helped to keep my concentration in a… let's just say distracting circumstance (Brande grits his teeth a little) I must admit it did help though, even if it wasn't through methods I was used to.
{[b]Angelo:} It sounds… interesting. I suppose a bit of harsher teaching is good from time to time, and if it helped then that's all that matters. Maybe I won't try any arcane training, I'm not sure I'd live to see the end of it. I'm sure a match between myself and Aleya would be greatly entertaining for everyone, and I can see how it would go - I'd end up in a tree somewhere.
{[b]Brande:} Yeah I wouldn't recommend a sparring match, I think any of us except Ganraz and Shamus would end up the same way. Though I think if there was enough distance between me and Aleya, I could win a match. Especially if I do manage to learn to use these wings properly.
{[b]Angelo:} (laughing) Those are fighting words, Brande. Be careful she doesn't overhear; you may have to prove yourself. (He stands, and his butterflies disappear) I think a training session between the three of us is a good idea, if we ever get the opportunity. I... I'm sorry, I haven't been myself for a day or so. If I had been, I would have come to check on you sooner.
{[b]Brande:} That's alright, I'm glad you're feeling better. I'm fine myself, if a little tired. (He grins) A training session would be fun, perhaps you can show me how to kill a Wyrmlord with butterflies.
{[b]Angelo:} Sure. Why walk when you can run? We'll start with the really advanced spells and work backwards, it's much more fun that way. (He then glances back towards the rest of Starsong Hill) I actually came down here to get you, I think we're going to be making plans soon. I've given Aleya and Ganraz use of my Black Book, but as I carry it with me everywhere, I imagine they'll want to use it again for planning purposes. So we should head back to them, if you're feeling up to it.
{[b]Brande:} Your black book? Is that the book you occasionally write in every now and then? What would Aleya and Ganraz want with it? I can head back, I'm quite happy with the progress I've made, and it'll probably do me some good to have a proper sleep. Only so far you can go on hour naps.
{[b]Angelo:} You haven't even been sleeping? Brande, you're getting worse than me. As for my book... yes, I suppose you would have seen me writing from time to time, though it's more likely you've seen my journal. My Black Book is... something else. I'll explain briefly on the way.
{[b]Brande:} (look at Angelo quizzically) Alright? It's not as bad as you think, part of my training was to recover quickly with only short periods of rest, you can't lay around for too long in the dessert at night as that's when most creatures are active.
{[b]Angelo:} It's kind of a… book of secrets.
{[b]Brande:} Do you mean your own secrets? If so then why would you want to show this to anyone else?
{[b]Angelo:} Mm, no, not exactly... (He looks a little uncomfortable) My own secrets go in my journal, that's for my personal use. My Black Book is for... business, I suppose. Or at least, it used to be. I haven't used it... much... in recent days.
{[b]Brande:} Huh. Well I can see you don't particularly like talking about it, are you sure this is something that you need to show the others? Have you had experience with this red hand before? Is this how you have some understanding of the dragons?
{[b]Angelo:} Oh no, definitely not. I'm a singer, Brande, a storyteller. I've read many a tale, and many of them involved dragons. I know a bit about them through my own personal research.
{[b]Brande:} I see. You are very knowledgeable about many different areas. You must have seen quite a few things. We have many stories in our tribe, though many of them are tales of my people, my ancestors or of Tine Síoraí and his deeds. But most of our stories serve as advice, experiences and trials of those who came before us, warning us of dangers and teaching us how to survive. You serve an important role passing on those stories. Perhaps I should teach you some of our stories, so that our advice can help those in other lands.
{[b]Angelo:} (kind of smiles at that) Perhaps. We could earn quite a bit of coin in taverns if our stories are interesting enough (The smile fades a little) My Black Book doesn't have stories like that though, necessarily. More... information. Collected over many years. Most of it's useless now, I suppose, but some of it is still relevant.
{[b]Brande:} I see (he goes quiet for a bit) I wouldn't write them off as useless. Many stories have more to them than just the words that are said. I'm sure you had a good reason to record them originally, and will be useful in their own way.
{[b]Angelo:} That's the plan. I intend to use my book to help the group, in some small way. Perhaps the knowledge I collected back then can help us in the future. I've heard a wide range of secrets, so maybe some people around here have secrets I happened to collect.
{[b]Brande:} It's almost like you are a collector of stories. Not just your own, or of your ancestors, but of any story you can find. Even if it is a story that others do not wish to tell.
{[b]Angelo:} I... yes, Brande. You're absolutely right. That's exactly what I am. (He looks less uncomfortable than he did, but he's still a bit off, like he's a bit worried about something)
{[b]Brande:} Sorry, I don't mean to pry, I always end up asking more questions than is good for me.
{[b]Angelo:} No, it's fine. I... I do collect many people's stories. Stories are powerful. Information is a weapon, when in the right hands. That's why I don't share much, or often. Information can be used against me. But I made a promise to someone that I would be better than I was. So now I'm trying to be useful in more ways than just throwing magic at hobgoblins.
{[b]Brande:} (grins) Though you are very good at that.
{[b]Angelo:} I do try.
{[b]Brande:} You're a good person Angelo, at least I believe you to be, for what it's worth. You have saved me before and I'm sure you will again. You think things through. You're good with your words and know how to use them. You are not rash like I am and know when to use your words, when to use your blade, or even when to use butterflies. I'm glad that I met you.
{[b]Angelo:} (doesn't meet his gaze, turning so his hair covers his face from Brande's view) I'm not really much good, but that's kind of you.
{[b]Brande:} You are too hard on yourself. I may not be the smartest but I can tell there's something that either you done or has happened that you are not proud of. But the past is the past. It is not something that can be changed, but it is something that you can learn from, and grow stronger by accepting. If you keep letting it hold you back you're going to find it harder to keep moving forward. (There is a pause, and Brandel lets out a hearty sigh and puts his arms up with his hands behind his head) God I sound like one of my elders or something with that line.
{[b]Angelo:} (snorts) A little. You do sound like some people I used to know. I... appreciate the sentiment. I suppose I don't want to be judged by the deeds of the dead. But I also want to uphold my promise, and try to use my skills for something other than personal whims.
{[b]Brande:} Well with everything that's been happening I would say you've been doing that already.
{[b]Angelo:} We'll see. There's a lot to be done yet. If my book proves useful then this will all be worth something, at least.`

`{[h]Starsong Hill downtime}
[It's still 17 Eyre, and our conversation with Sellyr has just concluded. We have yet to show her the box of death]
We decide to get shopping out of the way first. This occurs in bits over the two days of downtime, so for example Brande and Angelo go shopping at the end of the two days. But we do get it done.
Tarrick is no longer in the waters of Arawai. We head into Ota's tent to have a look at her wares, and the smell of pungent ointment. We hear grumbling, and the sound of her throwing things she doesn't need over her shoulder.
Vilgrim tells Ota he's collected everything she requested. She puts on her big glasses, and Vilgrim unwraps the fangs and vials of venom. Two monkeys clamber down from the rafters and gather up things, clearing the way. She is pleased with the haul, and says that he won't have to pay for the arrows he borrowed.
Brande asks for the bracers of archery. She says she still has them, and asks if he needs help shooting. Aleya, who didn't even want to go shopping, pops in just to say that he's shit at it.
She asks Gareth if he's a keeper of the old ways. She says he's a bit unorthodox, but so is Ota. He says he didn't intend to become a druid, but it worked out like that. Ota asks him what he thinks of the creatures we've been fighting. She asks him if he knew that dragons were the original teachers of druidic magic/magic in general. She says that the razor fiends are not of the natural order, so she says they must fight against them with all their might. Gareth asks if there'd be any help with that. He rolls a 15 on his persuasion. She then pulls a rhomboid out of a little box, and offers it to him. She warns that it will cost both him and Ota a lot.
Angelo rolls 21 on his persuasion, and Gareth haggles down to 25% discount. Ota agrees, and asks that we keep bringing her oddities. Angelo also gives her a green dragon scale, and a black dragon scale. We are now sort of in a contact with Ota to bring her weird shit. Gareth gains the stone which gives him +2 con. Angelo puts on the Boots of Elvenkind. Brande gets the Bracers of Archery. We also have the rope of climbing. Ota also allows Angelo to recharge his Staff of Orchids, which now has 22 charges.
None of us have any fucking money anymore, due to spending it all with Ota. Except for Aleya, who didn't pool with us.

{[h]The Starsinger's Roost}
[It's one of the days that we spend in Starsong Hill. The time is kind of weird to keep track of. It's probably 19 Eyre by now]
Sellyr invited us up into her tower. The ceiling is nothing but darkness, as it stretches into the canopy of the Ancestor's Tree. The room is white wood, and the walls are covered in diagrams of the stars. She gestures, and curtains draw across the windows. Candles light themselves, and the flame is blue.
She asks us what we want from her.
Vilgrim asks if she has been keeping track of the Red Hand. She says she has seen them burning Drellin's Ferry, and are about two days' march away from Terrelton. Vilgrim also asks if the dragons are with the main force. She had seen them only once, and saw the green and red dragons helping the horde to burn Drellin's Ferry. Gareth asks what's up with the moons and stars on the wall. She explains that the way the moons interact with the world can influence things. He asks if that can be taught or if it's specific to her, but it can be taught. Vilgrim asks if she's cast her gaze towards the Wyrmsmokes at all. She says it's been relatively quiet, but she doesn't look there very often. It's hazy.
Ganraz begins to explain about the Ghostlord's phylactery, and how the Red Hand were manipulating him by withholding it from him. Ganraz gets her the box and opens it. She closes her eyes, focusing on the phylactery, and it begins to lift from the box ever so slightly. The Lion's Vessel. The phylactery of the Archdruid ?????, now given the moniker Ghostlord. The phylactery drops back into the box as she releases her spell.
Sellyr, now herself again, says it is apparently blighted, and seeks to warp the natural order. She tells us a slightly different version of the Ghostlord fairy-tale we heard beforehand. The druids in what is now the Thornwaste were all united under the banner of the Archdruid, and they went up against Rhest. This later led to the fall of Rhestalor, due to the army being weakened by fighting cultists and crazy druids and cannibals, so they couldn't defend themselves as well against the hobgoblins.
Ganraz asks what happens if we destroy the phylactery. We could maybe do it with Sellyr's help, and he would be killable until he created a new one. We would also earn his eternal rage. Ganraz also asks whether the phylactery can be seen whilst in the box, and she says no. We show her the note that came with the phylactery. She suggests that it's possible that returning the phylactery could be an option, but recommends that if we are to destroy this, and seek to hunt the Ghostlord, it would be foolhardy.
The party debate in and out of character what the best plan is for dealing with the phylactery and a lich that will most likely kill us. It's easiest to destroy it by using druidic magic, and could be plunged into the Waters of Arawai, which would taint the waters for a number of years but would destroy it. The way to destroy it safely is to take it to a druidic grove, have a bunch of druids, and it'll take a couple of days.
We agree on a deadman switch – the phylactery will remain with the Starsinger, and she should send us a message to keep a check on whether we are alive or not. If we're not, or if we don't respond for whatever reason, she destroys the phylactery. Breland could probably crush the Red Hand, but if there's a Ghostlord in play that will all dramatically change. Sellyr thinks it's a fair plan, but is not without risk. If the Ghostlord manages to get to us, and finds out where the phylactery is, then Starsong Hill is in danger. She does however agree to take the box, and can send it to us if we need it in a pinch.

{[h]Extra stuff whilst we order food}
Angelo didn't sleep one night, compiling all of his knowledge into one place. Aleya finds him in the morning, and can tell he hasn't gone to bed. He's very hesitant to give her his Black Book, but he permits her to see one page, which has all of the info on Tiamat, demons, etc. Everything else is not visible; all she sees on every page is a kaleidoscope of letters in the Common and Elvish alphabets flying across the pages, never settling into words.
Then the Brande and Angelo conversation happens.
At some point in the two days, Angelo asks Jhen what some of the Breaker nicknames are. Seamus is Iron Arms. Ganraz is Tusk. Aleya is The Soldier. Angelo is The Noble. Brande is Nomad. These may have changed in our absence, but this is what Jhen knows.
Seamus infuses Aleya's armour with +1 defence, so her armour class is now 19.

{[h]19 Eyre}
We leave Starsong Hill, and it takes us just over a day to fly to Brindol. Killiar comes to us in the morning, and we all mount up. The first day of travel is mostly over the clouds, so Brande rolls for PTSD.
When we camp, Killiar asks if there's anything we should know about Lord ir'Jarmaath. He's considered a kind ruler, though he listens to his advisors on most things. Lady Varessa Kaal is noble by wealth, merchant family. Fiery red hair, rumoured to be the most cunning person in Brindol. Always dresses extravagantly. Captain Lars Ulverth, leader of the Lion Guard. Pronounced limp in his left leg. Angelo tells him this, and warns him and whoever is with him that they should be careful of Lady Varessa, as she is quite cunning. Angelo doesn't think she should be underestimated.
We follow the river for a while, and begin to see city walls appearing further away. Flying creatures are moving towards us, and those who roll a perception of 20 can tell they're gryphons with riders. One of them, with a blue sash around his armour, asks who we are. Killiar introduces himself, and the guard is satisfied that we are expected.

{[h]In the city of Brindol}
We follow the gryphon riders into the city, and it looks pretty busy. In the centre of the city is a set of beautiful gardens and manor houses, and Brindol Keep. There is some sort of procession at the top of one of the landing platforms.
As soon as we land, Angelo takes out his dark green side cape and puts it on. It's glamourweave, with star constellations shimmering over the surface. The one time Aleya rates Angelo's look, and it's just to tell him that his glamourweave is the most impractical thing she's seen.
We are greeted by Lord ir'Jarmaath, who is dressed in a similar but more extravagant style, and Lady Varessa. There are robins landing and flying around her. There is a minotaur and a half-orc woman with them, who both wear purple side capes that clash with the colours of Brindol, which is the blue. There is also a dragonborn, dressed in purple robes. His scales glimmer like gemstones, and appear to be topaz. He has a staff with a floating crystal, which only Seamus recognises as maybe being a dragon shard. To the right of the dragonborn is a man in his mid-40s, who has a receding hairline but dark hair, and a dark robe. He is dressed in the colours of House Cannith, and seems to have metallic scars framing his eyes. Angelo rolls a 19, but doesn't know who this person is. Seamus recognises this person immediately without rolling. A warforged we recognise is also there… Alpha.

[DUN DUN DUN. We break here for curry.]

Moored to another one of the towers is an airship, powered by elementals, with House Lorander(?) banners. Airships are co-built by House Cannith and House Lorander.
As we dismount, Lord ir'Jarmaath approaches and speaks for himself, instead of having someone announce him. The Talons salute them, and the Brindol party bow.
Lord ir'Jarmaath introduces himself, and says he's aware of some of us but not all, looking at the Talons. They introduce themselves individually, and Lady Varessa turns her nose up a little at the display. Lord ir'Jarmaath then introduces Jazzir, the dragon born, who is of Brindol Academy. The Cannith representative is Grand Maker Delaan d'Cannith.
We are offered a place to rest before we meet for a council. As we go to leave, the Grand Maker and Alpha approach us. The Grand Maker tells us that Alpha informed him of our ventures. Delaan is very excited to see "another Cannith face", addressing Seamus. Everyone but Vilgrim has a ! moment, because Seamus didn't tell us this. Delaan says he's studied under Seamus. He also mentions Merrick(?), but only Ganraz knows that he is apparently the closest in line for being the new leader of House Cannith, after The Mourning.
Delaan tells us that he's been working on reinforcing the city walls, after taking a brief tour of the Vale. He says he'd be pleased for help from Seamus. He then leaves Alpha with us.
We head down, hearing the sound of gryphons around us as they land and leave the towers. The owls are taken there to rest. We are lead down to the great hall. There's an elevated throne, not super over the top, but it's at the high table. Lord ir'Jarmaath is obviously up there, and Killiar and Lady Varessa are also at the high table. Delaan d'Cannith does not appear to be here.

{[h]In the dining hall}
Seamus notices that the arms of Alpha have noticeably been upgraded. This is definitely Delaan's work, it's too fancy and ornate for Seamus' taste. Ganraz and Aleya ask about Seamus leaving House Cannith, and he confirms he left them before The Mourning.
Angelo tries to subtly cast Detect Thoughts, to get a general overview of people around him and better gauge Lady Varessa, as she's been watching every table. He gets counterspelled, and looks up to meet Jazzir's gaze. The dragonborn shakes his head subtly at Angelo, who doesn't react. Aleya rolls int to see if she knows what Angelo tried to cast. She can tell it's divination of some kind, but doesn't quiz him on it.
Ganraz does a quick Know Your Enemy, and knows Lord ir'Jarmaath is stronger than us, but Lady Varessa is weaker.
Brande asks why people don't like warforged. In front of Alpha. The warforged. Seamus and Aleya answer, giving him a brief answer about the war.

{[h]In the war room}
Once dinner is finished, we head into the war room. There's a map on the wall, and those who roll over 15 can tell there are roadblocks marked on the map. The higher rolls can see there are notations for ogres and casters at the roadblocks. They've also marked off the horde's progress, and Drellin's Ferry is crossed out as burned. There are notations about potential aid from other cities, as well as marked minor skirmishes in the Witchwood.
Lord ir'Jarmaath says he's spoken with Killiar, who has told him of the things in Rhest. Brindol's forces have set arcane traps on the way to Terrelton, and have sent riders to deal with warg riders who have attacked stragglers from the caravan. Denevar are sending 500 men to help man the walls. Delaan has been fortifying the walls, whilst Jazzir has been preparing a transmutation ritual to shore up the damaged wall. He believes it can be carried out tomorrow.
Ganraz says that we are working on getting more aid, but he cannot give too much information on it, as it's of delicate nature. Lord ir'Jarmaath is not persuaded, and insists that we tell him anything that might be of importance. Ganraz tells him it's a lich. Lord ir'Jarmaath doesn't know what this means, but Jazzir instantly clocks this. He bends down and whispers info to Lord ir'Jarmaath. Jazzir says he will go and do some research, and then speak with individuals of our group after. The lord then goes on the explain how Ulverth has been forced to retreat from several skirmishes, without being able to deal significant damage to the horde. Lord ir'Jarmaath says Brindol is not the best place for civilians, and will send them on to Denevar whilst the rest of the city will be fortified against dragons.
This makes sense to us.
Delaan stands, and says he would like to take his airship to hopefully gather more aid. He wants to go into Zilargo (his eyes flick towards Vilgrim. Angelo notices, and will remember this). Delaan asks Killiar if he would mind escorting the airship with some owls. He also sends a message to Vilgrim, saying he would very much like to speak with him. Obviously, none of us are aware of this.
As we part ways, we can tell Lord ir'Jarmaath looks pretty tired, and he says he'd be happy to talk more after we've all rested.

{[h]Through Brindol, to Brindol Academy}
Alpha escorts us, at Lord ir'Jarmaath's recommendation, to the academy. The streets are busier than Brande has ever seen before. The buildings are reminiscent of Florence, and the evening is wearing on.
Aleya messages Angelo on the way, and tells him his previous attempt to use Detect Magic was a good idea. He replies saying it was worth a try, but the casters here are a little smarter than the ones we've encountered so far.
We arrive at Jazzir's study, but when we knock there is no response. So Ganraz opens the door without checking for traps. It's ok though, he didn't die. We find ourselves in the perfect wizard study, with books floating from shelf to shelf, reorganising themselves. We see a beautiful diagram of the planes. But beyond that…
We see Jazzir. Held up by his throat. By a robed figure.
[Everyone as one go from "oh levitation" to "oh FUCK"]
Aleya casts Magic Missile immediately, but it is dispelled in the air. The robed figure turns and smiles, saying, ‘Oh, come on.'
[Everyone realises, as one, that our worst fears are confirmed, and it definitely is Mr Flay even though we were hoping it wasn't. Fuck.]
He smiles, and says he wasn't expecting us to be here. His arm shifts and turns into what looks like a bone blade. There is a spray of blood across Jazzir's neck. He crumples to the ground.
The gruff voice says, "They took it", and Mr Flay says that we did. So he decides to stay.

{[h]Roll for initiative}
Initiative order: Mr Flay, Alpha, Brande, Seamus, Gareth, Mr Gristle, Ganraz, Angelo, Aleya, Vilgrim
My Flay is up first. He drops the robe, and his body is just made of writhing tattoos. He smiles, and says, "I didn't get to introduce myself. I'm Mr Flay…' His skin splits, and a being made only of muscle steps forwards, saying in the gruff voice, ‘And I'm Mr Gristle.'
We all roll wisdom saving throws. Brande, Ganraz and Seamus are all afraid of Mr Flay and Mr Gristle.
Mr Flay is basically a fleshy creature, and he flops over the balcony rail, lurching towards us. He can't speak now, but he holds his bite.
Alpha is up. They shoot twice, dealing 18 damage, then 13 damage.
Brande gets a Hex on Mr Flay, and then tries Mind Sliver (?) but it's a horrifying mess in there. Brande takes 5 psychic damage. He is still scared.
Seamus activates his arm barrier, but can't act because of the fear. He is still scared.
Gareth polymorphs himself, swelling into a giant ape, and rushes Mr Flay. He's too big for Mr Flay to bite now, so that action can't work.
Mr Gristle is next. He jumps down from the balcony. He takes 3 fall damage. Then he moves forwards into combat. He tries to bite Gareth, his jaw unhinging, dealing 18 piercing damage.
Ganraz is unspooked.
Angelo uses Countercharm, muttering in Elvish under his breath, and gives everyone within 30ft of him advantage on saving throws against being frightened and charmed. He then moves as far as he can to the left side of the room.
Aleya moves in for the kill. With Lakrith giving her help, she deals 19 force damage and then 29 force damage to Mr Gristle. She action surges and does it again. Her attack deals 21 force damage. Lakrith then flies up as far as he can.
Mr Flay and Mr Gristle are up, using a legendary action. Gareth, Lakrith, Aleya, and Ganraz need to roll int checks. Everyone but Aleya take 19 psychic damage, and Aleya takes 10. Lakrith is killed instantly. Everyone who fails must run in the opposite direction as a reaction.
Vilgrim takes aim. He fires a flesh-eater arrow at Mr Gristle, dealing 14 damage, and 3 acid damage.
Mr Flay sloughs towards Aleya, and tries to bite, but her sword keeps him back. As it's the beginning of the round, we see his wounds beginning to regenerate.
Alpha takes another shot at Mr Flay. 18 piercing damage.
Brande puts his Hunter's Mark on Mr Flay, and takes a shot. 17 to hit just misses. His second also missed.
Seamus stays the same distance away. He tries to grapple Mr Flay, but it just misses. He can however pull himself up when the fear goes away.
Gareth charges in, and makes two attacks on Mr Gristle, but it deals no damage, he's too sneaky.
Mr Gristle takes another 4 acid damage. He attacks on Aleya, and his first one misses because of her shield. Mr Flay casts counterspell on her, trying to counter her shield, and Angelo sees this, counterspelling his counterspell. She takes no damage. But the second deals 20 damage. The third deals 10 damage.
Ganraz is up, charging Mr Flay. He uses his trip attack, dealing 13 slashing damage and 3 frost damage. He carves through both of his legs, knocking him to the ground. Ganraz then attacks again, dealing 13 slashing damage and 1 frost damage to Mr Flay again. He uses his Shield Master to try and knock Mr Gristle to the ground as well. But Mr Gristle holds himself upright.
Mr Gristle makes two legendary actions, attempting to swallow Aleya whole. She manages to out muscle him, so he can't do it, but it's pretty horrifying to see.
Angelo sprints towards the stairs, past the combat and reaching the staircase. He then casts Healing Word on Jazzir, giving him 6hp back. He is alive.
Mr Flay tries to bite Ganraz, but misses.
Aleya attacks Mr Flay on the floor, dealing 15 force damage. Mr Flay is looking a little torn up.
Vilgrim is next. He shoots at Mr Gristle with a flesheater arrow, dealing 21 damage, 4 of which is acid.
Jazzir is alive. He stands, staggering to his feet. He holds out his staff, gasping, ‘Kill these abominations.' He casts Haste on Seamus.
Mr Flay regenerates some of his health. Mr Gristle doesn't because of acid damage. Mr Flay tries to bite Ganraz. His skin goes over Ganraz, and tries to cast Dominate Person on Ganraz. But he's unsuccessful, so he deals 18 damage whilst he constricts Ganraz.
Alpha shoots at Mr Flay, who is around Ganraz. They deal 25 damage to both Ganraz and Mr Flay.
Brande is unspooked. He uses Zephyr's Strike, and makes a Sharpshooter shot against Mr Gristle. He also pumps an Eldritch Smite, and uses a flesheater arrow. He deals 42 damage total. He is now prone, but he's still grappled Aleya. He makes his second shot, but it misses.
Seamus pulls himself up to the railing. He lights up the runes on his arm, and casts Enlarge on Ganraz. Mr Flay takes 13 damage as he's torn off of Ganraz, who is now Big Boi Ganraz. Chadraz. He then casts Firebolt at Mr Flay.
Gareth goes after Mr Gristle on the floor, dealing 25 bludgeoning damage, as Mr Gristle and Mr Flay are both resistant to physical damage.
Mr Gristle stands up. He takes 5 acid damage from Brande's arrow, and 7 from Vilgrim's arrow. He's still grappling Aleya, so he tries to swallow her again. He succeeds, and she disappears. She takes 13 damage. She is now unconscious.
Ganraz swings at Mr Flay. He deals 21 damage, and slashes Mr Flay's legs again. He's prone once more. He deals another 13 slashing damage and 5 cold damage. He uses his bonus action to shield bash Mr Gristle, and manages it. He knocks pregnant Mr Gristle to the ground [which is a cursed sentence that only occurs in dnd]
Mr Flay and Mr Gristle use their legendary actions again to use their Whispers of the Stained One. Ganraz fails, Angelo saves, Gareth saves, Alpha saves. Jazzir saves. Those who failed take 15 psychic damage, everyone who succeeds takes 8. Ganraz is unconscious.
Angelo casts his Spirt Guardians, dealing 9 radiant damage to both Mr Flay and Mr Gristle.
Aleya fails a Death Save. (Takes 32 damage). She also fails another Death Save.
Vilgrim dashes in and tries to carve Aleya out. He deals 25 damage, and Aleya is freed. Vilgrim takes 4 acid damage due to being in proximity of the spray.
Jazzir makes another death save. He fails.
It's a new round of combat. Mr Flay regenerates some hit points. He takes 8 damage from Angelo's butterflies. He then uses his action to merge with Mr Gristle. They are now one being again.
Alpha is up. They get sneak attack, so they deal 24 points of damage.
{[b][My laptop died at this point, so I may have missed some things, and I will be writing the remainder of the notes from memory and numbers I put in my notebook. If anything's wrong, make a note of where and let me know]}
Brande fires at Mr Flay, dealing 30 damage. He's looking pretty bad. At the end of Brande's turn, Mr Flay says it's been fun… so why not have some more. He then attacks Aleya, auto failing her last death save and killing her instantly.
Gareth attacks Mr Flay, dealing another 30 damage.
Mr Flay is next, but he doesn't get the chance to act. Angelo, seeing Aleya die, screams, his voice distorted by magic. His eyes burn with bright arcane energy, and his butterflies multiply into a swarm of silver, shredding through Mr Flay. He deals 13 radiant damage, defeating Mr Flay, but seemingly not killing him. As he fades away, Mr Flay smiles, saying, "Be seeing you soon."
Brande and Seamus go to get Jazzir and Ganraz back up, but Angelo sprints to Aleya, saying ‘I'm sorry' over and over again as he pulls her into his arms and grabs his Staff of Orchids. He tries to cast Revivify four times, but the dice gods laugh in his face and fail him each time.
Aleya Valantion is dead.

And that's where we end our session. Merry Christmas. The Scribe fucking yeets their dice into the fires of Mount Doom. `

`{[h]So. Last session. That happened.}
We're still in the academy.
Aleya's breastplate has been removed for better access to the wound, which seems to have been healed, but there is no life. She seems tranquil. Angelo is still kneeling beside her, but he drops the staff now. Vilgrim is cradling her head. Brande doesn't fully understand what's happening, so he uses his pearl of power to get another third level spell slot back and tries to cast Cure Wounds on her. It of course doesn't work.
Jazzir slowly stands, and reaches out a hand. His staff, which is at the bottom of the steps, shoots upwards and into his hand, and he uses it to help him down the stairs. Seamus casts Cure Wounds on him, and hears the dragonborn mutter under his breath, 'The Lioness.' He pace begins to pick up as he moves down the steps, as he gets closer Seamus hears him whisper, 'Poetry.' Then in a louder voice, he tells the others to remove the rest of her armour as there's something more he can do for her. Vilgrim and Brande rush to obey. He then reaches into a pouch, and pulls out two copper pieces, placing one on each of Aleya's eyes. As he finishes his incantation, he throws salt into the air, and ice covers Aleya's form. It's clear, we can see through it, but it is solid.
Brande asks if this is healing her. Jazzir has to explain to him that she's gone, but this spell will preserve her body. Things are happening, and it may not be time yet to say our goodbyes. [He has cast Gentle Repose on her, so there's 10 days left on it] The effort exhausts him, and he gestures for a chair to come to him. He says he needs to contact someone as he sits, and he begins to cast a spell. Angelo and Seamus roll arcana checks, getting 18 and 17 respectively. They can both tell it's not an uncommon spell, and seems to be casting Sending to someone, even though he doesn't speak. He then casts the spell again, but this time he speaks. 'I am pretty competent. I will discuss with them. Yes, I was there. I will be fine. Others are not so lucky.' Jazzir then tells us that he needs to talk to us, but will give us a few minutes whilst he messages other people to tell them of the attack.
Seamus rests his hand on Angelo's shoulder, telling him that everyone tried their best. Angelo replies that it wasn't enough, and walks off to a far corner by himself. Ganraz sheaths his sword and leaves the building, going off for a walk by himself. Jazzir sees him leave, but doesn't stop him from going. Seamus and Vilgrim remain standing over the body. Brande looks pretty horrified.
Jazzir returns, and says he will repay us in any way he can. The mages will retain the body. He then adds that we have much to discuss, and that he has contacted an ally. He starts to try and comfort us, but then sees we're really not in the mood for it, so he then tells us to meet him at the king's gate tomorrow. In the meantime, he's set us up in The Gilded Raven, the finest establishment in town, and everything is paid for. We're to tell the owner, Andraki Lenn, that Jazzir sent them, and everything will be sorted.
He asks before we leave if he can study Aleya's sword, in light of what we just fought. He promises to give it back tomorrow when we meet up. Angelo's pissed about it but can't think of a good reason to say no. The others all agree.
The rest of the party still in the building leave to go to the Raven, but Angelo asks Jazzir if he can access the library, because wizards have books. He gets pointed towards a few tomes. 18 investigation check. His focus is resurrection, and he's basically rage reading. It tends to vary depending on what religion you're talking about. Revivify, Silver Flame and dragonmarked house Golander(?). Doluhhr. The true soul slowly fades, and then it becomes hazy. Some suggest the soul is gone, leaving nothing but a faint echo. The Silver Flame suggest the soul merges with the Silver Flame. The Sovereign Host believe the soul exists on a plane that is not accessible until you have faded from Doluhhr. Higher levels of resurrection have been talked about, stories have been told about it. It does have limits on timing. Jazzir does comment that what he has done will extend the soul by ten days. The Silver Flame do have divine casters, but don't typically like resurrection, because it's seen as taking a soul from the Silver Flame, the truest calling for hero. The last bit of info he manages to get is that warforged, as per the "are they alive" debate, are shown to have souls and are therefore seen as living entities, but their souls do not seem to go to Doluhhr. Angelo rolls a 20 on his perception check, and sees Jazzir pick up one tome that was bound. It is titled, The Plane of Madness and the Entities That Dwell There. He had to literally unchain it to take it up to his study.
[It's about midnight now] He's been there for about 2 hours. He only takes one break to write briefly in his diary. Angelo takes a point of exhaustion, and finally gives up to go and sleep.
Meanwhile, the others enter The Raven. The doors open up to a grand entryway. Down the stairs sweeps a finely dressed half-elven gentleman, with blonde hair. [It's Angelo's cousin, damn] He introduces himself as Andraki Lenn. Vilgrim, Brande and Seamus introduce themselves as part of Jazzir's saviours. He then calls for "Sie" to help him. A human woman, wearing a nice dress, with long blonde hair. She's wearing a necklace that appears to have a shard of crystal attached. She gestures for the three of them to chill in a booth.
Vilgrim goes up to the bar, and asks for something strong. Andraki is happy to help, going off on a mad one about all the alcohol he can serve. Siennis telepathically tells Andraki to chill, and he pours Vilgrim a drink. Then he assesses our group, and pours Vilgrim a bit more.
Seamus is knackered and emotionally spent, so he goes up to the room key.
Vilgrim stays in the booth, listening in on some conversations, but he doesn't listen to much.
Ganraz sits by the river for a bit, and then goes to The Golden Dragon instead, which is notably more rowdy than The Raven.
Vilgrim is still up and receives a message. 'You are to meet with the Cannith agent. Listen to what he has to say, and report back.' It's a different voice to the one he's encountered before. He doesn't answer, he just spits. Andraki doesn't notice, but Siennis does. She doesn't act on it.
Seamus gets to his room, and gets ready for bed as much as possible. He pulls a pendant out of his pocket, and sends a message to his daughter. "Hello. I know I haven't spoken to you in a long time now, and you haven't spoken to me either. Today I lost a friend, and it made me think of you, and how I lost you too. I hope I hear back from you." There's a long pause [literally the discord is so quiet, fuck, the tension] "Father, it has been a while. I'm sorry to hear of your loss. There are so many losses lately. It is good to hear from you. Pascal and I are safe. I hope you are too."
Angelo does eventually come in, very late, and goes straight to the bar. "I want something strong enough that I can forget my own name." He downs it and goes up to bed.
Siennis doesn't live at the Raven, so she's leaving. As she does, she telepathically asks Andraki if he's going to stay up. They have a cute telepathic flirting moment, but it looks like nothing to anyone else, obviously.

{[h]Waking up in the morning}
Most of the party wake up in The Raven. Each room has its own ensuite, with self-heating baths, magic hair dryers, full length mirrors, etc. Seamus recognises all of this as pretty new, Cyran tech. The furnishings are even nicer/more modern that what Angelo had in Cyre.
The DM asks Brande to roll a percentile dice.
The whole party: Oh no.
Brande's sleep is restless. He has visions of Aleya's death over and over, and feels this surging rage. It feels… good, to channel this grief into the people who deserve it. He feels that it's their fault, the dragon's fault. He's drawn through a cloud of rage and grief, and the red smoke solidifies into a single point, which begins to grow, until it's a single red shard. It's ruby red, and appears to drift towards him. It seems to be no bigger than 5 or 6 inches. The hate begins to fade as the hate and the emotion begins to drift away, and he wants this thing. He wants the calm it gives him. And then he wakes up.
Ganraz, meanwhile, asks for directions to the Raven. Luckily, we sort of stand out, so he asks if the nearest person has seen "the red guy". They know him as The Nomad, so they know our Breaker names, sweet. He joins us for breakfast.
Andraki is doing his best to look after the party, offering tea and food. Brande asks if he has more meat. The DM has a menu somewhere. Siennis is not here yet. Andraki tells us that he's Draki to friends, but Ganraz insists on referring to him only as Andraki. He asks about the airship, and the dignitaries aboard it. Captain Eirros d'Lyrander, and it seems to be a joined endeavour with House Cannith. He admits that's basically all of his knowledge, and asks how he should address Ganraz and Seamus, as they're dragonmarked bois so he doesn't know if he should call them "my lords". They insist on only using their names, which he's fine with. Andraki asks if he should address them as d'Tharask and d'Cannith or not, and Ganraz immediately says no, his house doesn't use that, he's d'Barra. Andraki is incredibly embarrassed and flustered by the mistake, and hurries off.
Siennis is wearing a red dress this time, and notices us sitting for breakfast, and looks away to walk past. The dress shows a bit more of her back this time. Seamus and Ganraz roll perception, and get 17 and 23 respectively. Seamus doesn't notice anything other than her entrance. Ganraz does notice something off, as his gaze is sort of drawn away from her, and he's not sure if he imagined it, but there's a blurring effect near her back. He does a double take, looking back at it, but then her back looks normal. She goes to the bar, talking to Andraki who's hurriedly cleaning things. She tells him (out loud) that she'll need to leave earlier today, because she needs to go and speak to Jazzir. Hopefully she'll be here to help him pack when the city is evacuated. Andraki is still flustered, and notices that she's not fully enthusiastic about it. He then goes off on a tirade about not being briefed on the proper decorum when addressing dragonmarked heirs.
Brande goes over to Angelo's corner, and sits next to him. He asks if Angelo has ever seen a red crystal shape that might be magical. Angelo looks at him for a second, just absorbing the vagueness of that question, and then gets out his Black Book to have a look. He rolls a 15 on his history check, and he's heard of rubies etc for spell components, but he doesn't have much more info than that. Brande uses Minor Illusion to show him what the crystal looked like. Angelo asked if he saw that in Jazzir's room, because he didn't notice it. Brande says he thinks it will help. Angelo narrows his eyes, remarking that it didn't answer his question. Brande thinks that it will help stop what's happening to Aleya, and stop "what's happening".
Vilgrim asks if we can all follow him, and Andraki gives us a side room with curtains. Vilgrim begins, "As an old friend once told me…… The span of someone's life makes up only the core of their existence. No one is finally dead, until the ripples they cause in the world die away. On the grand scale of things, I knew Aleya for but a fleeting moment. Despite that, the mark she left behind will doubtless remain upon all of the lives of those who gather here today."
Angelo is literally about to walk out of this room.
Then Vilgrim continues, "With this thought, I must confess something to you all now. Before Aleya made her final journey, I made a promise to her, and despite her indifference to me keeping it at the time, I intend to follow through on it.
In normal circumstances I would never tell a soul what I'm about to tell you. But, in times like these…. and seeing as I've grown to trust you lot with my life over these past short days…. well… let's just say that I haven't been entirely straight up with you all, nevertheless, I'd like you all to at least hear me out.
For many years now I have worked to gather and exchange all manners of information at the behest of my government. In fact, that's how I ended up in this situation in the first place. A simple reconnaissance mission on the character of a caravan of refugees…
Well, with the… gravity.. of the situation that we find ourselves placed in continuing to grow and grow in magnitude, seemingly without end, its more than time now for me to do what I can."
Angelo's about to walk out, until Vilgrim says he's got something to confess. Vilgrim admits that he's been gathering intel for his government, and that's how he got to join the caravan anyway. Now that shit got real, he wants to do what he can to help our party, so that nothing happens again like what happened to Aleya. He plans to travel back to his homeland, which he hopes will allow him to bring aid. He doesn't know if he can do it, but the attempt is worthwhile. He then goes on to say that even though he knows that the relationships with some of the party members hasn't been exactly positive (Angelo snorts), he hopes the party can forgive him for being deceitful. Brande says Vilgrim is brave for confessing, and Ganraz says that Vilgrim has fought with us, so he's welcome to return and have a drink with Ganraz.
Andraki pops his head back in, and asks if we're available to talk to two people who have come with a message for Vilgrim and Seamus. Alpha barges past him [which is fucking rude, we should kill Alpha, Andraki is a GOOD BOI]. They hold up an orb they are carrying, and we hear Dolaan's voice come through, telling us he wants to meet with Seamus and Vilgrim at the earliest convenience.

{[h]Meeting with Jazzir}
Siennis has left a while ago.
It is rammed, there are guards calling to people, and there's a lot of people rushing towards the riverfront, where the King's Gate is. There's seems to be some commotion down by the river. As we approach, people sort of notice us and move out of the way. There used to be a wall here, and buildings have been built into the remains.
At regular intervals, we can see various Brindol Academy mages, with Jazzir in purple in the centre of the bridge. Everything goes silent as Jazzir finishes his incantation and raises his hands. The water level along the river pulls back and draws upwards. There's a 30ft high wall of water being maintained in the air, and the other members of the academy step forwards to help move this huge wall. They pull it back towards the King's Gate, until it becomes level with the bank, and begins flowing over the buildings. Jazzir steps back with the wall, until he finally reaches the King's Gate, and then drops one hand. As one, he and all the students push. It turns into a deep wall of ice.
There must be thousands of people, all watching, and as it freezes there's this loud intake of breath, and then everyone starts cheering.
Jazzir turns and addresses the crowd. His voice seems to be amplified. "By the will of the Academy, Brindol will not fall." There's a massive cheer, and the 50 students bow with him. As there's clamour all around us, Jazzir spots us. He apologises for the theatrics, and we join him on his journey back to the academy, to return to his study.
Naturally, this place immediately brings back terrible memories. Everything has been rearranged though, and Aleya has been moved to the Cathedral of the Sovereigns. As we enter, we see Siennis, who is wearing very practical but basically new leather armour, which is a mix of greens and greys. She seems to be prepared for more intensive activity.
Jazzir gestures for us all to sit, and Siennis goes over to him. She places a hand on his shoulder, and casts Lesser Restoration on his to remove fatigue, because he's obviously exhausted. He sits up a little straighter, and thanks her. He also thanks us again for his life. Now that he's had time to study the entity that attacked, he realises the true level of threat that we're dealing with. He first introduces Siennis properly, as Siennis Theil. We all hear her voice in our heads, telling us that it's nice to meet us. Ganraz and Angelo disliked that. Brande finds it weirdly familiar, which piques Siennis' curiosity, because why Brande. Jazzir goes on to tell Siennis to maybe not do that until we're used to her. He adds that he cannot leave Brindol, but Siennis can act in his stead. He then says he will leave us to discuss with Siennis.
Angelo and Seamus recognise her speech as one of who's from a noble household. She stumbles a little over the words, as if she's not used to speaking out loud. She apologises for startling us, and also for our loss. She knows she cannot replace "The Lioness", but she wants to help us with whatever we plan to do. Except for Seamus, none of us have heard of Aleya referred to as The Lioness.
Jazzir says he has researched the Ghostlord, Mr Flay, and also the sword of Usak Vaal. He asks which we'd prefer to hear about first. We pick Mr Flay, obviously. He explains that Mr Flay and Mr Gristle are entities of the Plane of Madness. He tried to fight them off using his – he says this in all of our heads – innate abilities. Everyone disliked that. He then asks if we'd heard of the Daelkyr, which is related to the mural we found way back in the prologue, in the tomb of Usak Vaal. The aberrations came through from the Plane of Madness, and were fought off by the Dekani(?) Empire. The Empire fell, even though they did manage to beat back the aberrations. Mr Flay and Mr Gristle were originally known at the Grimmkin, and they are two of three. They are the creation of a powerful being known as the Stained One. Trying to interact with such beings telepathically brings great pain, which is why Brande took damage when he tried to inflict psychic damage.
Siennis asks Jazzir telepathically if it's possible that the third one [the bone boi] is being used to control Mr Flay and Mr Gristle somehow. He says it's possible, and she relays this to the rest of the group. [So we're fighting Mr Flay, Mr Gristle, and Mr Calcium/Skeletor]
Jazzir also explains that the sword is good to use to destroy the Grimmkin for good. It will be our greatest weapon against the aberrations, and should be wielded by a champion. That's probably why the Red Hand wanted it; if Azarr Kul had it, he could sway more to his side.
He moves on to the Ghostlord, and knows the Stone Lion in the Field of Wounds, which is a tangle of sentient thorns. Jazzir's contacts who have investigated this area before have seen spectral lions. If the Red Hand are to use the Ghostlord's forces against the Vale, Brindol will probably fall. He also isn't sure about how our plan to convince the Ghostlord not to fight will go down, as he was a twisted, evil man. Dragons are bad, but he puts the Ghostlord high on the threat list.
Jazzir also tells us that one of the prominent guard captains in Denevar was attacked, but he's still alive. There was also an attack on the Hammerfist Holds, in which a couple of the leaders were killed. They all discuss different figures taking part in the attacks, but given the creature's abilities, it's probably Mr Flay and Mr Gristle masquerading as various entities.
The Grimmkin can't be truly destroyed unless all three are dead at the same time. We don't need to kill them simultaneously, but they all need to be dead at the same time.

{[h]We let Jazzir rest and shift to Vilgrim and Seamus' meeting}
The two of them head to the keep, seeing the Lyrander airship still tethered. They are met by Alpha, who leads them to the chambers of Dolaan. There's a desk which Dolaan is sitting at, and he's got a swivel chair that he seems to have brought himself.
He scooches over to where Vilgrim and Seamus are sitting, and says he has something to show them. He reveals a lifesize mechanical hummingbird, which flits around his head. Dolaan proves that he's Vilgrim's biggest fanboy, as he made a bird just for him because he knew Vilgrim likes birds. Seamus doesn't see the practical application, but ok fam, my friend died last night.
Dolaan gets back to business, and says that the Cannith agents will be reinforcing the wards set up by the Brindol Academy, and shoring up walls elsewhere. He fears that this city needs more aid that what limited augmentation he can provide. He then explains that he was here on a diplomatic mission, as House Cannith is currently in political turmoil. Many ambitious minds wish to lay claim to the house, and many of the traditional heirs were killed in The Mourning. There are three candidates. One is Zorlan(?) d'Cannith, who Seamus has heard of. His dragonmark appeared on his head, so he shaved his head. Dolaan says he wouldn't chuck in with him. There's Jorlana(?) in the west, and thinks her political past is sketchy at best, and would make a mockery of the House. Merricks is the best option, and he's based in Sharn. Even though he doesn't want to lead, he's the most suitable, and has Dolaan's loyalty. So, he gets to the point. He's well aware of Vilgrim's connections, and has been in contact with his masters. He believes they can work together, as House Cannith and Zilargo have worked together in the past. He is also aware of why Seamus disavowed the house, and notes that what Seamus and his brother did was outstanding. Dolaan also finds some of what House Cannith did during the war was distasteful. Jorlana holds the most favour at the moment, but thinks that with Merricks being bolstered he can lead. At the moment, they will be helping the Vale. Vilgrim will travel with Dolaan to Zilargo to discuss the arrangement with them. He hopes this will be the start of a profitable way forwards for both Zilargo and House Cannith. They don't need to decide anything now, but that's his full offer.
Seamus says that it's a very well thought out offer that he's made. He asks what the House can bring to the Vale if he accepts the offer. Dolaan says he's done work on the gates, and can leave a contingent of capable artificers if needed to maintain the wards. He doesn't have the assets he wished to bear, as he came here for diplomacy, not war. Seamus admits that his support would encourage him to take up Dolaan's offer.
Dolaan openly admits to not being the greatest fighter.

{[h]Another brief timeskip}
There's the sound of horns and bells ringing from Brindol keep. There's initial panic, and then we hear the call go out, "Ulverth returns! Gryphon riders on the horizon!"
There's a refugee caravan coming up the road, escorted by 5 gryphon riders above, and 5 gryphons fly ahead with the cavalry. Angelo recognises the colours of House Cristole at the head of the convoy.

We end the session here

`{[h]At the gates of Brindol}
The call went up announcing Captain Ulverth’s return.
We have all returned to the keep and are looking out of one of the towers. We see six gryphon riders, some of which are circling a large train of refugees. Two gryphons break off from the pack, heading straight towards Brindol keep.
We all roll perception checks. 15 and up, we can see Jarmaath and some of the lion guard coming up to greet the riders. We notice that the gryphon riders are moving with haste towards the keep. The cavalry are moving quickly along with the caravan. They seem to be moving faster than we’d expect, heading towards the South Gate. The gryphon riders seem to have plate armour. The lion guard seemed relaxed initially, but upon seeing the gryphon riders their hands go to their word. 20 and above, they can see the caravan seems to be 400ish people, and House Cristole colours are at the front. From Ganraz’s military perspective, he can see the cavalry seem to be patrolling as well as herding, and are at attention.
As the gryphon riders approach, we make our way to the top of the tower. The riders have majestic armour, and we can see the gryphons seem to be showing signs of minor wounds. Brande can see that one has minor gashes that are healed over, and the other still bears large barbs around its neck. They look more like large porcupine quills than the talons of the razor fiends. Both riders dismount and bow to Lord ir’Jarmaath.
One is male, the other female. The male, late 20’s, cleanshaven, athletic, 6’1”, looks like the purest example of a chivalrous knight. He has long brunette hair that’s been pushed back. The woman is shorter, 5’10”, has two shortswords. Both are very attractive. Ganraz can see they both look tired, but like skilled warriors. They look similar, potentially related.
Jarmaath greets them. Ser Elizabeth and Ser Justinian. Elizabeth says they were sent ahead by Ulverth, who went back to help the part of the caravan that got cut off by warg riders. Ser Justinian says that they were being led by a Guard Captain to Tersken Ridge, which they hope will provide relative safety. Jarmaath can have six ready quickly, the rest are on patrols.
Lord ir’Jarmaath asks us if we can help. We naturally agree. 2 score warg riders, draconic entities with them, but no dragons. A cohort of manticores supporting them. They lost two riders trying to get the refugees out.
We have five minutes to prepare. We take the time to divvy up Aleya’s gear. Ganraz is naturally in charge of it. He gets the Gauntlets of Ogre Power. Ganraz also gets Aleya’s sword, because he wants to kill Mr Flay with it. Lightsaber on his hip, Vraath’s Frost on his back. Ganraz of Rivia, let’s go. Brande gets Ganraz’s Ring of Adrenaline. Her spellbook is added to Angelo’s things, but he’s sort of looking after it rather than intending to use it.

{[h]Let’s fight some wargs}
Seamus and Vilgrim haven’t made it back in time, they’re still with Dolaan.
Sir Justinian mounts up again, and we also get on gryphons, one each. These creatures are larger and more majestic than the one we found on the road two weeks ago. Siennis has just been thrown headlong into the chaos, welcome to our world, once you walk out this door you are a Breaker.
As we soar overhead, the shimmering barrier over the gate disappears, allowing the first riders into the city through the South Gate. We swoop by the caravan too quickly to get a good look at who’s in the House Cristole stagecoach. There are a lot of people who looked injured, but they’re moving quickly to the city.
We bank away from the caravan. The flight to Tersken Ridge takes about 25 minutes. We see grassy slopes giving way to rocks. As we approach, we see a melee going on. There seems to be a circular formation of soldiers surrounding maybe 80 or so refugees. There are also two gryphon riders in the air. Warg riders trade arrows with the soldiers. There’s a snarling manticore coming at us from the right, and one of the gryphon riders yells as his gryphon and the manticore lock in the air. Ganraz reacts at the last second, knocking an arrow out of the air with his shield.
Ser Justinian calls out from the front, ‘I can’t see Ulverth!’
Another manticore banks in our direction, flicking his tail in our direction. A huge gryphon swoops low, and the rider summons a wall of force that scatters the quills in midair. Siennis reaches to her side, lifting a crystal handle and focusing for a second. A thin trickle of blood falls from her nose as she uses Crimson Rite, prepping to utilise her whip. The gryphon rider’s helmet has been knocked off, and the man we know to be Ulverth shouts for Justinian to help Sigrun on the south side. Justinian nods, telling us to descend and look for a dwarf.
The goblins have noticed our arrival and are trying desperately to press their attack, hoping to get to the refugees before we do. The gryphons land, skidding to allow us to dismount, and then taking off again. Brande looks at his hand, and then jumps from the gryphon, casting Fly. Angelo disapproves but literally can’t stop him. They immediately move to engage some of the manticores in the air. We roll off of the gryphons, standing to get our bearings. We see a thin line of soldiers, a couple get strafed by manticores and some warg riders.
One warg jumps up the ridge, leaping towards one of the soldier, and this stocky figure in full plate brings their axe down, cleaving through the warg’s shoulder, then quickly killing the rider too. As the dwarf stands again, we see her helmet is gone. She has a mane of flaming red hair, matted with blood, wearing armour similar to the rest of the soldiers with lions. She’s out of breath but has a feral grin. She turns and yells at us, ‘Nice of you to show up!’ Before returning her focus to the rest of the fight.

{[h]The Battle of Tersken Ridge}
Initiative order: Siennis (and Vilgrim later), manticores, Sigrun, Ambush Drakes, Brande, Angelo, Ganraz, (later Seamus), (later Robin), (later Ozyrrendion), soldiers
Siennis is up first. She skids to the ground, and takes a second to survey the carnage. There’s battle all around, but this was the area we were told to defend. She moves towards the ridge, which is 10ft down. Seeing some draconic looking demon gods, she fires two Eldritch Blasts at the blue Ambush Drake. She deals 5 force damage, and then 11. Instead of energy, they form as shards of crystal. From the large crystal she used her Crimson Rite on, emerges a broken chain of purple energy.
Two manticores swoop down out of combat with the gryphons. They’re about 30ft up. The red manticore makes three tail spike attacks. One is at the green soldier, and two at the blue soldier. Blue soldier takes 9 damage, and then the second quill kills him. He lands near Angelo, who can see that he was probably early 20s. The blue manticore attacks, two at green soldier one at orange. The attacks on green soldier miss, but orange soldier takes 5 damage.
Sigrun is up. She moves forwards to the edge of the ridge, holding her action for when something gets in range.
The drakes are next. They clamber up the ridge. Sigrun reacts, attacking the red drake and dealing 11 damage. Red drake bites at Sigrun, but misses. Green drake rushes up and tries to bite orange soldier, but also misses. Blue drake rushes up, inhales, and exhales blue vapour over Siennis and green soldier. Both of them succeed their con save. The drake looks frustrated.
The DM asks someone to roll a d10. Nick rolls a 6. Nothing immediately happens. The party groan.
Brande is 30ft in the air. He hangs back, flying nearer to where Angelo and Ganraz landed. He uses Hunter’s Mark on red manticore, and shoots. He deals 24 damage. He shoots again, dealing 22 damage. The red manticore is looking pretty pissed off and hurt.
Angelo runs towards the edge of the ridge, summoning his Spirit Guardians, dealing 22 damage. The green drake looks pretty hurt, and backs away from the green soldier. It has definitely noticed Angelo now. He then bonus action generates Vestige. A long Elvish blade appears in his hand, silver with dark grey filigree, same as his butterflies.
The warg riders are up. Red warg rider attacks red soldier, dealing 9 damage and knocking him prone. The second attack deals 6 damage. The warg makes a bite attack, using its reaction, but it misses. Blue warg rider launches a javelin at Sigrun. The first attack deals 4 damage, second deals 14. Green warg rider tries to make an attack against Sigrun. First one misses, second hits, dealing 13 damage. She succeeds her strength save. The warg tries to bite her but misses. The purple warg can’t do anything yet, because it only just got up to the ridge, but it takes 24 damage from Angelo’s butterflies (both warg and rider).
Ganraz runs down to orange soldier, and attacks green drake, dealing 10 slashing damage and 3 cold damage. His second attack also hits, dealing 7 slashing and 3 cold. The orange soldier sees butterflies swirling in, forcing the drake away, and then he sees a half-orc warrior come out of nowhere and slam into this drake. It’s definitely dead. Orange soldier looks at Angelo and Ganraz in awe, and says, “The Breakers!” Ganraz ignores this, using his commander’s strike to tell Brande to shoot at the red warg. Brande shoots at the warg, not the rider, and with sharpshooter he deals 27 damage. The red soldier is trying to keep the warg off of him, holding his shield up against his chest. The warg gets killed instantly, and the goblin tumbles from its back. Ganraz also commands Siennis to attack, and she uses her reaction to lash out against the blue drake. She deals 19 slashing damage, and 8 psychic damage. The whip almost extends in a straight line, and the tip pierces through the drake’s chest, and its head explodes. Ganraz then uses his bonus action to put Hunter’s Mark on the purple warg.
Orange soldier, inspired by the Breakers rocking up, charges forwards shouting, “For Brindol!” We kind of didn’t want him to do that, but ok mate, we’ll save you in a sec. The goblin takes 10 damage from orange soldier, and gets killed. Green soldier kills the warg with 10 damage. The Red Hand don’t stand a fucking chance against these boys. Red soldier attacks the red goblin, dealing 24 points of damage.
Top of the round, our roll takes effect. Another ambush drake runs in from the right. Brande, from his vantage point, can see a line of militia further up the map, and can see non-combatants near to them. Things seem to be stabilising on our side, but it is still chaos all around.
Siennis is up. The energy of her whip flares as she lashes out, utilising Mental Discordance. The whip does 10 slashing damage, and then 10 psychic damage to the red drake. Her second attack just misses.
The manticores are next. Red manticore soars at Brande and unleashes three attacks at Brande, as he’s flying. The first attack misses, but the second hits. It deals 8 slashing damage. The third attack missed. He succeeds his con save, so he’s still airborne. It attacks again, dealing 10 damage to Brande. He rolls another con save, and succeeds again. The blue manticore flies down, taking 12 damage from Angelo’s butterflies. The first attack deals 4 damage, and the second deals 8 slashing damage. He succeeds both con saves, so his butterflies are still up.
Sigrun is next. She swings at the red drake first, as it’s the most hurt. She deals 11 damage, killing it. She then turns and tries to beat the shit out of the green warg. It hits, and she deals 14 damage. She attacks again, rolling a 19 which is a crit. She deals another 27 damage, and the warg is very much dead. The goblin falls from its back, and falls prone. Sigrun roars in the face of the goblin that’s fallen, and it plus the blue warg rider have to roll wisdom saves. The blue warg fails, the warg rider succeeds, and the prone goblin fails. The fails are frightened. She stays put.
The drake is up next. Poor little guy. It tries to use its breath weapon on Ganraz and Angelo. The drake takes 8 damage from butterflies. Both Ganraz and Angelo succeed their con saves.
Brande is up. He attacks the manticore in front of him, dealing 15 piercing damage. Red manticore is still up. His second shot also hits, dealing another 18 piercing damage. Red manticore falls from the sky. Brande moves his Hunter’s Mark to the new drake.
Angelo deals 17 damage to the manticore by using Booming Blade and his Vestige blade. I love this sword. He then shouts to the green soldier, “Stay alive, and get back!” casting Healing Word on him and giving him 9hp back.
The goblin on the ground starts flailing wildly, dealing 8 damage to Siennis. He then uses Nimble Escape to get the fuck outta dodge, but he fails his acrobatics and falls down the ridge. He’s prone again and takes another point of damage. The blue warg rider throws his remaining javelins, and his first misses Sigrun, but the second deals 4 damage to Siennis. Orange warg leaps up the ridge, attacking orange soldier. He takes 9 hp. The warg then tries to attack the green boy, but orange boy has got him. The warg takes 10 damage but the goblin takes 20 damage. Then the warg takes orange boy down. For the next turn, someone has to roll a d10. Ganraz gets 10.
Ganraz moves his Hunter’s Mark onto the blue manticore. He deals 11 slashing and 6 cold damage. His second attack deals 10 slashing and 1 cold. It looks really hurt.
The soldiers are up. Red boi uses his movement to run towards Sigrun and Siennis. He fires his crossbow at the rider of the blue warg. He deals 6 damage. He reloads. Green soldier disengages, obeying Angelo’s instruction, and runs back to safety.
That’s the end of the round. From where he is, Brande can’t recognise any of the refugees, but he can see an ambush drake break through the lines and get absolutely smacked down by Markos fucking Contraine. What a badass. We hear the flapping of loud wings, and a large manticore swoops down, snarling, “Fools!” Oh good. It speaks. But joke’s on the manticore, because from the sky… Seamus and Vilgrim swoop down on gryphons, readying firebolts and arrows.
Vilgrim takes a retroactive 19 damage from the fighting.
Siennis’ turn. She moves towards the manticore, lashing out with her whip. Her first attack deals 9 slashing damage and 8 psychic damage. Her crystalline whip slashes across its neck, wrapping around, and there’s a pulse of purple energy and its head explodes. She then turns to the new manticore, the beeeeg boi, and casts Mind Thrust on it. It fails its save, so it takes 13 psychic damage and can’t do anything its turn except for Dash or Disengage.
Vilgrim is up. 60ft behind him the refugees have clustered, so he’s making sure the line holds. He fires at the ambush drake, dealing 27 damage in one hit. He’s back, boys. The drake looks pretty bad. Bonus action wink.
The alpha manticore can only dash or disengage. It dashes, but it can use a bonus action. It roars, “Fight, die, rip, tear.” And howls, rallying its allies. All of its allies gain advantage on attack rolls, which are the warg and the drake. Everyone else has nearby has to roll wisdom saving throws. Angelo, green soldier and Vilgrim succeed. Siennis and Ganraz fail their wisdom saving throws, so they are frightened. The manticore is still in the air, 20ft up.
Sigrun is next. She takes a running leap, bringing her axe down on the goblin that’s running from her. She deals 15 damage, and sticks the landing. Her second attack deals 19 damage, which definitely kills him. She then spins, facing the blue warg behind her, swinging wide. She deals 14 damage, and it’s still up.
The drake is next. But Angelo’s butterflies shred it with 23 damage. It’s dead.
Brande moves his Hunter’s Mark onto the big manticore boy. His first attack misses. His second attack deals 32 piercing damage, with a smite pumped in. He would be knocked prone, but he’s flying, so… We reckon it would fall down, so Brande has grounded him. The big manticore then takes butterfly damage, which is 11 damage because it saves.
Angelo is next. He runs forwards, using Booming Blade on the warg attacking orange soldier. He deals 17 damage, which kills it. He then casts Healing Word on orange boi, giving 7 healing.
Sigrun takes 6 slashing damage from the blue warg rider.
Ganraz is up. He steps into the path of the manticore, and tries to attack. It misses, but he is frightened. He moves his Hunter’s Mark onto it. His second attack does hit,  dealing 15 slashing damage and 4 cold.
Seamus is next. He casts Branding Smite and tries to hit the manticore twice. His first attack misses but the second deals 20 damage. He’s then asked to roll a d10 by the DM, and he rolls an 8. The DM says that’s interesting. YIKES.
The orange soldier boy comes to, healed by Angelo’s magic. He says, “Thank you, my lord.” Oof, no, don’t call him that. And then charges into combat with the manticore, dealing 13 damage. Green boy is still listening to Angelo’s order, and runs to the edge of the map. Red soldier moves towards Sigrun.
New combat round. A couple of things happen. The manticore we’re fighting is taking damage but isn’t down. A cavalry charge breaks through a group of warg riders. It looks like the last real engagement on that side. Ulverth is diving to fight with the cavalry. We hear screams from the direction of the refugees. A green scaled creature strafes along the cavalry, and six riders go down in a cloud of poisonous green. Ozyrrendion has returned. Ganraz rolls a 30 on his perception check, and can see that the green dragon has a dark burn scar across his face, the kind Gareth’s lightning might leave. We also see a warg break through the cavalry, charging for green soldier boy, but then two daggers fly forwards, killing the warg. Robin has joined the fight, FUCK EM UPPP.
Siennis is immediately drawn to the dragon. She deals 13 points of force damage with her Eldritch Blast, and then uses her blood maledict to heal herself. She is now not frightened anymore.
Vilgrim sees the manticore facing Ganraz, and shoots at its flank. He deals 22 damage to it. It’s starting to look as though it’s suffered some wear and tear.
The alpha manticore is looking pissed off. It doesn’t get its roar back. It looks up to Ozyrrendion, and says, “I have these weaklings.” It whips its tail in a spray of spines. One attack against Siennis, Angelo, orange soldier boy, and Ganraz. Siennis takes 14 piercing damage. Angelo takes 10 piercing damage. He saves on his con. Ganraz doesn’t even need to raise his shield, it just clangs harmlessly off his armour. Orange boy takes 9 damage, goes down again.
Sigrun attacks the warg rider and then the warg. Her attack on the goblin is a 19 to hit, so she deals 21 damage. He’s very very dead. Her second attack also hits the warg, dealing 17 damage and killing it too. She twirls her lion axe, and brings it down right over its head. She then clambers up the ridge, making it up with no problem. She sees red soldier at the top reloading his crossbow.
Brande is next. Angelo warns him with a look that if he starts acting up again now that a dragon is here, they will have words. Instead, Brande shoots at the alpha manticore. His first attack misses, but his second deals 17 piercing damage.
Angelo gives orange boy another 7hp, and he’d better stay up this time. He then attacks the manticore with his Vestige, dealing 13 damage with Booming Blade again.
Ganraz takes a swing too, dealing 12 slashing damage and 6 cold damage. His second attack deals 14 slashing damage, and 6 cold damage. He gets the How Do You Want To Do This. As it moves towards him, he ducks to the side, slicing downwards, and takes the manticore’s head off. He then yells, “WE’RE KILLING THAT DRAGON.” The party is ready to fuck things up.
Siennis speaks to Ozyrrendion though telepathy, in draconic, and tells him he’s not welcome here, he’s a traitor to his kind. Ozzyman replies that she’s not as clever as she thinks she is.
Seamus brings up his arm barrier, and then yeets a firebolt at Ozyrrendion. He deals 15 fire damage. Then he backs up, because he doesn’t want to be clustered.
Robin is next. She sees the manticore go down, and hears Ganraz shout that we’re killing the dragon. She looks to Ganraz, and says she thinks it’s a good idea. She’s not within range of Ozyrrendion, but she holds her action to throw her weapon.
Ozyrrendion is next. Shitu. He flies down, landing on the rock, and he does get his breath weapon back. He says he was hoping Aleya would be here. He then uses his breath weapon. Siennis is the only one who fails the save. Angelo, Ganraz Constitution d’Barra and orange boy take 26 poison damage. Siennis takes 52, and she is unconscious.
Orange boy rolls a death save. He fails. Red soldier fires his crossbow at Ozyrrendion. Green tries too, but they both miss.
Siennis fails her death save too.
Vilgrim gets out his flesheater arrow which he didn’t give Brande, obviously. He kneels, raising his bow, and deals 56 damage. Ozyrrendion grins at Ganraz, who’s trying to help orange soldier boy up. And then BAM, Vilgrim’s arrow slams into him.
Sigrun dashes at Ozyrrendion, and takes two attacks at it. Her first is a 19, which is a crit. She deals 27 damage with her first hit. Her second attack misses because he casts Shield. She can make another attack, and she rolls a 20. DM demands she show him the dice. The party are losing their minds. Her attack deals 27 damage again. She tries to frighten him, but he saves.
Brande puts his Hunter’s Mark on Ozyrrendion, and takes a regular shot at the dragon. He misses because of the dragon’s shield. In his mind, he focuses on the shard from his dream, and tries to take another shot. It still clatters against the shield.
Angelo runs to Siennis, dragging her behind the nearby rock to give her some cover from the dragon, and casts Healing Word, giving her 12hp back. She wakes up, and hasn’t been afraid like this for 13-14 years. Interesting.
Ganraz sees Ozyrrendion on the ground. He moves to flank the dragon, and tries to attack. He moves his Hunter’s Mark onto the dragon, but his attack misses. He tries again, and his second attack hits through the shield. He uses his trip attack, dealing 17 slashing damage and 2 cold damage. Ozyrrendion fails his saving throw, and it knocked off balance.
Seamus doesn’t get closer to a dragon, so he firebolts and runs. It misses, and he runs to where red soldier boy is, so he can heal on the next turn.
Robin is next. It’s a little bit too much fun for her, but she does throw two daggers at the dragon. The first misses, and the second one clangs off the shield. They return to her hands. Bonus action dash, and gets the fuck outta there.
Ozyrrendion’s shield drops. He doesn’t get his breath weapon back. He makes three attacks against Sigrun. She takes 18 damage from the bite. The first claw also hits, dealing 11 slashing damage. She’s on 1hp. The third attack misses. That’s fucking lucky. He then flies upwards, 40ft, and tells us we are all insignificant. Ganraz and Sigrun need to take an attack of opportunity. Ganraz’s hits, as does Sigrun. So Ozyrrendion uses his shield again. Sigrun’s still hits though, dealing 6 damage.
Orange boy rolls another death save. He succeeds this time. Red boy shoots at Ozyrrendion, but of course misses. Green boy moves off the map, heading towards the refugees to help Ulverth.
Siennis is alive, and uses half her movement to stand. She deals 7 damage and then another 7 with her Eldritch Blast. She then moves up with the rest of her movement, and uses Mind Thrust. Ozyrrendion takes 7 psychic damage because he succeeded his INT save.
The walking turret called uses simple geometry to shoot at the dragon. He misses unfortunately.
Sigrun can’t do much now that the dragon is flying. Instead she beats on her arm, roaring a challenge at him, and holds her action in case he comes back down. She uses Second Wind to heal herself for 17 points.
Brande flies towards the dragon, and immediately uses Zephyr’s Strike to give himself advantage on the hit. His two shots miss because of shield.
Angelo runs forwards, seeing the dragon in the air, and his eyes go black. He shouts, “Land” in Elvish, commanding the dragon to land. The dragon’s will breaks, and the dragon begins to descend. He then shouts in Common, “Fuck him up, Ganraz.”
Ganraz uses Second Wind to give himself 10hp. Then he uses Commander’s Strike on both Brande and Vilgrim. Ozyrrendion retroactively takes 5 acid damage. Vilgrim’s attack deals 16 damage and 3 acid damage with his flesheater arrow. Brande’s attack missed.
Seamus uses firebolt on the dragon. It misses, unfortunately.
Robin is next, and she’s miles away. She’s not in range, he’s too far up, so she moves and holds her action.
Ozyrrendion takes more acid damage from Vilgrim’s arrows. He takes 6 damage. The dragon is still up. He lands on the rock, and that spends his action. Sigrun held her action, but her attack misses because he recasts his shield. He doesn’t get his breath weapon back. He takes 12 damage from butterflies as soon as he lands. Angelo gets the How Do You Want To Do This. Ozyrrendion snarls, “No, she promised…” As Angelo says, “You are insignificant.” And the butterflies shred the dragon.

{[h]Well holy shit, we actually killed the dragon}
Cheers ring out from the refugees and the soldiers, and Ulverth raises a golden sword. Refugees run towards the Breakers, and cheers and shouts of “The Breakers!” echo across the Tersken Ridge. Vilgrim sneaks behind a tree to avoid being trampled by people rushing to celebrate. Many people gather around Ganraz, excited to meet a real hero. We roll perception checks, and Angelo gets 21. At first he doesn’t see many people, but then he notices Markos and Hardag, who are helping Jast to walk. Some riders chase the wargs that are fleeing. Siennis goes over to the dead dragon, and rests her hand on its head.
Markos grins at us. We’re a sight for sore eyes. Jast is happy to see us as well, and thanks us for turning up when we did. Jast sits down next to where Vilgrim is. Seamus casts Cure Wounds on Jast, and the bite in his leg immediately knits over. Markos shakes Ganraz’s hand, telling him that the refugees have heard a lot about the exploits of the Breakers.
Ulverth approaches and formally introduces himself. He then properly introduces Sigrun, affectionately calling her “cub”. Justinian approaches too, with slightly less shiny armour now. Justinian tells Ulverth that they lost 35 men and 18 horses. Ganraz says that it won’t comfort them now, but we made them pay. The loss our enemies suffered here is huge. Ulverth agrees. They’ve also only counted 5 lost refugee lives.
He asks if we are indeed the Breakers, and we confirm that is what they are calling us. He thanks us for our service. Then he sends Justinian to gather soldiers and refugees to get moving towards Brindol.
Brande goes up to inspect the dragon. He can now see the burn mark on the face. There’s no other distinctive changes, from what he can remember of our last encounter with this boy. Vilgrim also inspects the dragon, hoping to work free one of the scales that he can take with him to Zilargo. That’s easy enough to do, and he does also notice that its fangs are dripping a continuous stream of poison. He collects a little bit of this, and gets 2 vials.
Ulverth notices Vilgrim and Brande messing with the dragon, and suggests we have the honour of bringing back the head of the beast. The people of Brindol need the head of the beast. Sigrun immediately offers her services as chief beheader. It takes a few blows, but she does manage to take it. Siennis walks away, not happy with the display. Angelo notices her actions, but doesn’t comment.
Green and orange boy are both healed up. Orange boy goes to Angelo, referring to him as Mr Noble. Merth is orange boy, and Ben is green boy. Merth was early-mid 40s, Ben is his son. They thank him for helping, and Angelo awkwardly accepts, letting them know they don’t need to call him a noble.
For the sake of expediency, we head back to Brindol. Siennis goes to get on a gryphon, but the gryphons get more and more uneasy as she approaches. She mutters, “Of course”, and goes back with the caravan. We all decide to do the same. Brande hangs back to cremate the corpse of Ozyrrendion, and no-one objects. He speaks a few funerary words over Ozyrrendion. As he watches this dragon burn, he feels both a sense of pride and euphoria. He’s not sure if the emotion is his own, and it doesn’t overtake him, but he feels something resoundingly good.
We return to the city, it takes us maybe 2 hours. As we approach from the outside we can see the trenches have nearly been dug. There are guards all along the walls, cheering the returning caravan. Brande is holding the dragon head. Flowers are being thrown. Siennis takes the earliest opportunity to escape out of the crowd and go home. She consults some books, whilst everything’s still fresh in her mind.
Seamus sees two small children run between the legs of the guards, and Meryll and Tressa say they’ve missed him. Meryll is still clutching his sword, and Tressa whispers in Seamus’ ear, “I did what you told me to, I kept an eye on him.” Seamus asks if they’ve been causing any trouble for Elaine, and they admit they have been a bit. Elaine is in the crowd, and she appears very heavily pregnant.
Ganraz sees Elaine too, and tells her that he missed her. She missed him too. Markos interrupts their moment, and says some refugees will be staying in Lady Veressa Kaal’s manor grounds.
At the steps of the keep, we see Elise ir’Cristole and Itaan Netanis, both alive. They nod to Angelo. Dolaan d’Cannith is also on the steps, and next to him are a couple of figures we hadn’t noticed before. A half-elf stands beside him, tall with some stubble, with swooshed over hair. He’s wearing a short sleeved tunic, and on his arm is a pronounced dragonmark of storms. The dragonmarked characters recognise this, and Angelo as well. This is Captain Eirros d’Lyrander.
We’re led into the keep, and presented with a victory feast. We had time to clean up and change clothes etc. Speeches are made in our honour by Lord ir’Jarmaath, who discusses not only the bravery and sacrifice of the lion guard, and also commends the swift action of the Breakers.

{[h]Prepping for war council}
After the victory feast, we head to the largest tower, where the airship is moored.
Dolaan is there, and seems pleasant enough. He hopes it’ll be a quick diplomatic mission. He says that at Seamus’ request (he emphasises Tarsch instead of d’Cannith), he has left artificers etc to help with the wards. He himself is not a fighter, but he’s heard impressive things about our recent victory. He allows us time to say goodbye, and then boards, accompanied by Alpha.
So, Vilgrim is at last leaving us.
He approaches Angelo first, and looks up into his eyes. He then extends his hand, which Angelo sighs and takes. He reminds Vilgrim that he’s the reason he’s in this mess. Vilgrim grins, because he knows. And he hopes he can do some good elsewhere. Angelo nods, and then warns him to be careful of d’Cannith. The bard doesn’t trust his smile.
Then Vilgrim turns and says goodbye to the others, shaking each of their hands. Ganraz tells him to hurry back. Markos, appearing behind us, agrees that Vilgrim doesn’t want to miss all the fun.
Vilgrim: I’m going to miss you all.
Angelo: *tuts* No you’re not, you liar.
Vilgrim, grinning: I will miss some of you.
To Brande, Vilgrim is a little more tentative. Brande takes his hand, and Vilgrim is unsure how to give him good advice. Jastiz lands on Vilgrim’s shoulder, ruffling his feathers and cocking his head at Brande. Brande gives Jastiz some of his rations, and Vilgrim is pleased by the gesture.
To Seamus, he admits he never really expected to make the sort of friends he’s made over the past weeks. Then he sticks out his little hand, and Seamus takes it with his big hand.
As Vilgrim goes to board, Killiar and Sheyla land with their owls, and ask if he’s ready. They say they must make haste. Killiar says he’s eager to see how fast the airship can fly. Vilgrim disappears inside, and we hear a deep hum of electricity as the elemental fires up, and the airship flies south towards Zilargo, with the owls escorting it.

{[h]The War Council}
[It’s currently late on the 22nd Eyre]
With Vilgrim gone, we head to the council chambers. There’s a large map of the Vale in the centre of the table. Ulverth did extend the invitation to Siennis, as she fought, so she turns up to the war council. Jazzir is there too. She’s wearing new clothes, and looks more upbeat than she was before. Lady Veressa Kaal is there. Guard Captain Surana. A man wearing a red side cape, the colours of Denevar. There are various members of the Lion Guard, including Justinian, Elizabeth, Sigrun. Jast and Markos are also there.
Ulverth continues his address. “With that caravan, what refugees we can safely get to the city have made it here. On the way here, we were harassed by the green dragon, and I thank you Breakers for dealing with that threat.” He goes over losses, and says their cavalry took a heavy hit. 120 good horses left, and riders to ride them. About 40 gryphons left. The owls of the Longclaw tribe are on their way, which will help. The lord of the Hammerfist Holds report that they cannot safely make the journey with their force. The roads beneath Terrelton and Dauth are unsafe, and report use of fell magic and robed, dangerous figures that can cast fire from their hands. It is possible to send aid, but from their best guesses the main horde of the Red Hand have almost reached Nimon Gap. They are essentially two days ahead of schedule. Best guess, we have ten days until they reach Brindol. Apparently they’ve been force marching, and he doesn’t know if the Breakers have had any influence on that. But, the forces of Denevar have managed to reach Brindol.
Lord ir’Jarmaath thanks the Denevar captain for his presence. Brindol is the most defensible city, and this will be the best place to try and hold them. Jarmaath plans to give the non-combatant citizens two days to head to Denevar. They will be escorted by 200 of the Denevar guard, whilst the other 200 will support the walls. The Longclaws are sending 250 archers, and are likely to reach this place before the Red Hand.
Jazzir has given reports of the Ghostlord, which Jarmaath also addresses. He asks us what our intentions are, as the rest of the council will be busy shoring up the defences and training those who will volunteer to fight.
Jarmaath asks how we intend to destroy the Ghostlord. Ganraz explains that we think it’s important to take the lich out of play. Jazzir lets us know that he’s been working on an enchantment to help us traverse the Field of Wounds safely. It will take him 2 days to finish. We could be productive in that time, helping with training and maybe check in on the Hammerfist Holds. We have been given gryphons to work with. Other problems, the self-proclaimed baron of Red Rock and Elsir Cross, Hargil Trask have refused to send aid. This naturally pisses off the Lord Paramount. Veressa Kaal is thoroughly unimpressed by him, and says that he could be bought. Angelo’s little elf ears are pricking up; you don’t always need to buy people to get what you want.
Ganraz asks if we know the numbers of the baron’s forces. In Red Rock, they’re not super well trained, but it is dangerous beneath the giant shield mountains and they can handle themselves. They perhaps have about 150 fighting men. Elsir Cross has a population of near 900. Ganraz says that he doesn’t speak for the group, but he thinks we might be best suited for trying to gather people from Red Rock or Elsir Cross.
We do some quick out of character planning, because it’s easier. Lord ir’Jarmaath reckons we’ve got 10 or 12 days before the horde reach Brindol. They reckon the horde will stop and take time to camp and prep before laying siege. It’ll be about 2 days to get to where we think the Ghostlord is.

We end the session here. We’re now Level 8.`

`{[u]Context: }
After the war council, Angelo catches up to Siennis, and they talk whilst walking through the streets back towards the Gilded Raven. They make a quick stop at her house.

{[u]Conversation:}
{[b]Angelo:} So… How are you feeling?
{[b]Siennis:} (Telepathically at first) Better, thank you, not… (Then she remembers that no-one likes telepathic communication and continues verbally) That was, err, the first time I've, err, fought. Bit of an experience, and not a pleasant one. Thank you for asking, I appreciate it.
{[b]Angelo:} (cringes a bit at hearing her voice in his head) That's... good. It certainly was an experience. Sorry you got dragged along into the chaos. If it's any consolation, most of us didn't sign up to be here.
{[b]Siennis:} I apologise for the... method of communication. It is much more comfortable for me. But, if you don't mind me asking, how actually did you all get here? I know so little about any of you. I mean, you're Angelo correct?
{[b]Angelo:} Oh. (snorts a laugh) Yes, I'm Angelo. Soliloquy is my bard name, but I think that's too long for people to remember. I got here mostly by accident, and then ended up stuck with the caravan. Now I'm apparently a "Breaker", which is... fantastic.
{[b]Siennis:} Soliloquy huh. As in the literary device where one speaks their thoughts aloud? And a given name in the same vein as 'Noble'.
{[b]Angelo:} (narrowing his eyes a little) Hm.
{[b]Siennis:} If it makes you feel better, one usually finds that very few things happen by accident. There is an order to events that always finds a way to occur. You are meant to be here.
{[b]Angelo:} I've been told that a few times. I know where I'm meant to be, and it's not... Never mind. What about you? You seem to have some interesting talents, and yet you work in the Raven?
{[b]Siennis:} Oh, I'm originally from Aundair, but had to leave during the war. I just ended up here and the previous owner of the Raven took me on. Been here about 10 years now I suppose.
{[i]Angelo rolls an insight check. She beats his 20 insight with a 21 deception. His passive perception is 14, and she beats that too with her 23 sleight of hand roll, casting Detect Thoughts.}
{[i]She’s not trying to probe his thoughts. On the surface level, there’s a lot of distrust she senses from Angelo, and a lot of guilt. He’s not hostile towards her, he just seems to be trying to figure her out.}
{[b]Siennis:} I'm sorry to be direct. But if you don't feel that you are meant to be here, and are clearly not entirely comfortable with it, then why do you stay? It would not matter anyway, everyone is always where it has been determined that they should be.
{[b]Angelo:} It wouldn't exactly be right of me to leave now. After all, without me they'd lose half of their common sense.
{[b]Siennis:} (laughs at that) They all seemed to know what they were doing earlier. Though the Nomad mentioning other voices in his head does worry me slightly. I would expect that none of you are fine right now. Grief takes a long time to heal. I am truly sorry though. This won't make you feel better, but do understand that it was meant to be.
{[i]As we continue to walk, we eventually get to the area near the Gilded raven, but instead Siennis turns into a side street (Basically around Candle Road). As we reach the side street, he'll start to slow, not sure if he should keep walking with her or not.}
{[b]Angelo:} Speaking of voices in heads... Forgive me if I seem rude, but I feel it's important to ask. How exactly does that work for you? I haven’t seen you cast anything.
{[b]Siennis:} Don't just stand there. Unless you have something against entering buildings? (she gives him a wry smile)
{[b]Angelo:} (returns the wry smile) It's the Elvish blood. I need to be invited.
{[b]Siennis:} (laughing again) Well, if you insist, I grant you permission to enter my place of residence. If you're actually a vampire though then please don't eat me. Draki would never stop laughing.
{[b]Angelo:} No vampires here. Sunlight does wonders for my skin.
{[b]Siennis:} I don't need to cast anything. It's just speaking but non-verbal. You have the ability to cast spells, and one of the more basic ones allows you to communicate one-on-one non-verbally. It's no different, just more efficient. Why speak when you don't need to?
{[i]She leads him up a short staircase and then opens a door at the top. Inside you can see that it's a pretty nice space. Not that large, but well and comfortably furnished (you get the impression that Siennis was raised somewhere with good taste). You're immediately in what can be considered a living room/study and on one side is basically covered in bookshelves which are full of books. The desk is covered in bits of parchment and ink wells and there are two books open on the desk. Siennis walks into another room. Angelo has a peek at some of the books. The books are a wide mixture of stuff, from translation guides to fiction. There is a lot of stuff on history and magic though. The book, the notebook and the scrawlings on bits of parchment on the desk are all written in what looks to be runes. He doesn’t recognise the language. He doesn’t try to flip through pages or anything.}
{[b]Siennis:} (calling out) Can I get you a drink or anything?
{[b]Angelo:} I won't intrude for long, I assure you. I just wanted to be sure I understood your... method of communication correctly. I have another question, if you're willing?
{[b]Siennis:} Of course. Ask me anything you would like to.
{[b]Angelo:} If you can speak in my mind without needing to cast anything, then how much do you actually see? Can you look into the minds of others?
{[b]Siennis:} No, it just lets me talk to people.
{[i]Angelo assumes she’s lying so he insight checks her. Siennis rolls a 17 on deception. The Insight Check Master herself must be watching over him, because with Ghost Aleya’s guidance he gets a 23 insight. He can tell Siennis is lying, but he’s seen her literally melt people’s brains so he’s not sure exactly what her capabilities are. Her lie makes him smile tiredly.}
{[b]Angelo:} (To himself, in Elvish) One more thing to keep an eye on…
{[b]Siennis:} (In Elvish) Keep an eye on what? Also, do you want a drink at all? (She has brought out two glasses and filled one with amber liquid.)
{[b]Angelo:} (stares at her for a second, surprised, and then barks a laugh. He sticks to Elvish, because nothing is sacred now so why not. She also sticks with Elvish) Of course, that’s just my luck. ...What do you have?
{[b]Siennis:} What do you normally drink? This is sort of a favourite of mine. It's a distillation from a place near Fairhaven (She pours him out a glass and hands it to him. Also gesturing for him to sit). Also do you prefer Elvish or Common?
{[b]Angelo:} I'll take anything, I'm not that fussy. And it's been a while since I've had anyone to talk to in Elvish, so if your vocabulary allows, we can stick with this. I'm happy to go back to Common if you prefer.
{[b]Siennis:} Either is fine. I am fluent in both. Do you have an objection to me directly communicating? It really is much easier. If you don't want me to then I don't mind.
{[b]Angelo:} (thinks about it for a moment, then takes a sip) I will admit, I don't like the thought of you rooting around in my head. I'm not good with new people and I don't trust easily. That much is probably obvious to you, little mindreader. But on this one occasion, as you are my host, I will allow it.
{[b]Siennis:} (looks slightly relieved by this. And from now on will speak telepathically.) Thank you. I do appreciate it. If you don't mind me asking, your appearance at least suggests that you have spent some time in polite society. Where did you study?
{[b]Angelo:} I had a tutor from a young age, when my magic first surfaced. Much to his despair, I'm sure. And then I went to a college for a little while. But quite a lot of my abilities are self-taught. Yourself? I see a lot of books here on the study of magic.
{[b]Siennis:} The important thing is that you had someone to guide you. It was much the same for me. I was born doing what I can do, but I met someone who helped mould them into something useful.
{[b]Angelo:} Where did you study? In Fairhaven?
{[b]Siennis:} No, somewhere far away from anything to do with the war, thankfully.
{[b]Angelo:} Your abilities are impressive. I have no safeguards against someone like you. I don't have any tangible way of stopping you, but I would ask you to not read my mind. (Then his eyes narrow) Unless you already have.
{[b]Siennis:} You have my word. But you do not need to be so on guard. I am trying to help, that is all. I said that I will assist you all in any way possible, and that is what I intend to do.
{[i]He insight checks, because that’s the first thing you do when you hear someone say they want to help, but she doesn’t roll deception because she’s being honest.}
{[b]Angelo:} (grinning) I'm always on guard. Ask any of the other Breakers.
{[b]Siennis:} Well, there is much to be gained from wariness. On that note, what can you tell me about the others?
{[b]Angelo:} For a start, the one you call ‘Nomad’ is Brande. Do people really not know our true names?
{[b]Siennis:} I mean, most people have never met you, and correct me if I'm wrong, but you don't seem like the type of person who goes around telling everyone your name.
{[b]Angelo:} That’s… true. It's annoying to be stuck with 'The Noble', but it's too late for all that now. In any case, yes, Nomad is Brande. He loves making new friends, I'm sure you'll get along just fine. Our leader, in an unofficial capacity, is Ganraz.
{[i]He goes through all of the Breakers, but he doesn’t give full names. He also gives brief identifying descriptors, like “half-orc warrior” or “human artificer” etc, so she can put names to faces, without giving out too many details. He doesn’t mention Aleya.}
{[b]Siennis:} So Ganraz and Seamus are the dragonmarked heirs. I can't say I've ever had much to do with the houses. And Brande is the one with the voices. I don't suppose you'd know what voices they are do you?
{[b]Angelo:} I... have an idea. But I think it would be best if you asked him that question. Be warned though, he's being unusually vague recently.
{[b]Siennis:} You intrigue me, go on?
{[b]Angelo:} (shakes his head) I'm usually the vague one. Perhaps he's just adopting my habits. He is known to be naive, but recent events may have changed that. There are some things I need to look into.
{[b]Siennis:} Maybe I could help you there? I am quite used to looking into things. What type of things in particular?
{[i]With her passive perception, she can see his body language shifting to something more guarded. Not hostile, just defensive.}
{[b]Angelo:} Perhaps you could help. You would have to talk to Brande first though.
{[b]Siennis:} I appreciate we barely know each other, but I cannot help if I don't know how to. If you would prefer I talk to Brande, then I shall, but different perspectives may well be helpful.
{[b]Angelo:} Different perspectives are indeed helpful, and I'm sure yours is very interesting, little mindreader. But Brande sometimes forgets to distinguish what is said to me in confidence or not, so I will err on the side of caution. If he opens up to you, I'm more than happy to discuss this again. As I said, your perspective intrigues me.
{[b]Siennis:} Then I will talk to him and consult with you afterwards. There is no harm done by making sure no boundaries are crossed. One more question if I may? That Dragon earlier, you had encountered it before?
{[b]Angelo:} Yes. We met Ozyrrendion at Skull Gorge. He was defending a bridge that the Red Hand intended to use to cross and invade the Vale. We killed the Wyrmlord with him and broke the bridge. Thus, we earned our moniker - 'The Breakers'. Ozyrrendion fled the battle just before we killed Koth. Why do you ask?
{[b]Siennis:} Only because you had clearly encountered him before and I was curious. What do you know of dragons?
{[b]Angelo:} I've heard a fair few stories. I didn't think any existed until we encountered Ozyrrendion. I can tell you that the bigger the dragon, the older and more powerful it is. Dragons get stronger with age. I know that black dragons spit acid, green dragons breathe poison, and so on. I also know about the Age of Demons, and some of the stories from that time. (He tilts his head) You seemed very interested in Ozyrrendion. Are dragons a particular study of yours?
{[b]Siennis:} You could say that, yes, I certainly have a vested interest in them. (She leans back and takes a sip of her drink) You are correct in general terms with what you know. The part that interests me is that Dragons generally believe strongly in prophecy and do not tend to act overtly, unless it is in relation to the elves of Aerenai. It is unusual for a dragon to be acting this way, let alone be so far away from its homeland.
{[b]Angelo:} They aren't acting alone. The Red Hand worship The Dragon Queen, which seems to bind them all together. (He takes out the Tiamat pendant) You might recognise this. The more zealous members of the horde carry these.
{[b]Siennis:} I do indeed recognise it. I find it plausible based off that that these Dragons have been manipulated into believing that it is foretold that Tiamat will return. Either that or they are interpreting events very differently.
{[b]Angelo:} I think that's most likely what’s happening. Some of them talk as though she's already back. But I’d like to think we would have noticed if that were the case.
{[b]Siennis:} I hope that that is the case, but do not be so certain. Entities that have existed for as long as Tiamat work on a scale far beyond our comprehension. Predicting what they will do is only possible through the actions of those who serve it and other, more esoteric methods.
{[b]Angelo:} If we had the opportunity to catch one of the monks maybe, or Ulwai's war priests, we might stand a chance of better understanding what exactly they intend to do. The Lurkers didn't seem to know, and I doubt we can catch a Wyrmlord.
{[b]Siennis:} The Lurkers?
{[b]Angelo:} The Lurkers worked under Wyrmlord Saarvith. They were scouts, spies, and kept a watch on the Blackfens, occasionally scouting as far as Drellin's Ferry to keep an eye on the Vale. Saarvith is gone now, so I have no idea what happened to them.
{[b]Siennis:} If they have no ties to the religious aspects, then they may have returned to Darguun. But I do not know enough about the situation there. I am sorry about these questions. If you wish to rest then you need only say. It has been a tiring day for us all. I need to return to the Raven anyway. Draki will want to know I'm ok.
{[b]Angelo:} No need to apologise. I've interrupted your evening long enough. But, to make one thing clear... I don't want you going in my head. Ever, if you can help it. It's not a safe place for you to be. (He takes a breath) I will, however, allow you to communicate with me via your preferred method. I admit I still find it... unsettling. But strangely enough, I believe you when you say you want to help. So if it's more comfortable for you, then I will tolerate it.
{[b]Siennis:} No need to apologise. I invited you here after all, and you have given me much to think about. I have given you my word that I will not pry if you do not want me to, I have no reason to make you uncomfortable. For what my word is worth, I do just want to help, as difficult as it is for you to trust me. But I would not expect anything else, you have lost a friend and are clearly troubled. It is much less hassle, but if you would like me to stop at any time then you need only say. I do not wish to antagonise you. Now, if you give me a minute I will escort you back to the Raven. Providing that is where you wish to go.
{[i]She gets up and goes into a side room for a minute. She then comes out wearing a fine silvery grey dress, collects a couple of things from the desk and heads over to the door. She is still wearing the same crystal necklace and you can now see the whip handle seemingly attached to her side, but on closer inspection is actually floating there. Angelo, being the one who’s collected quite a few dragon scales, notices that the piece of crystal has been cut from a much larger piece, and it actually looks somewhat similar to Jazzir's scales, though obviously not topaz.}
{[b]Angelo:} Very pretty (it's not clear if he's complimenting Siennis in general or commenting on the necklace that he's noticed)
{[i]Siennis rolls an insight check. Angelo, the bard who has expertise in deception, so he’s the good-at-lying one, rolls a 22, which cannot beat her natural 20. He’s not lying, but he’s being vague again, that’s why he rolled. But, she’s a mindreader, and he’s on like 12hp, that’s the only excuse.}
{[b]Siennis:} Yes, it is, isn’t it? Thank you though. Normally it's just Draki that says I'm pretty. I think most people are slightly confused when they talk to me. Force of habit I suppose.
{[b]Angelo:} Andraki is correct. Ignore the others. Let's get you back to him, no doubt he's heard many a horrific tale about the battle today.
{[i]They start to head back to the Raven, which is only 5 minutes away.}
{[b]Siennis:} Oh undoubtedly. I'm sure he have some interesting ideas about it all. He's a good man though, been kind to me over the years.
{[b]Angelo:} He does seem to be a good man. And it appears he's well aware of your strange talents. I'm sure that was an interesting first encounter.
{[b]Siennis:} Well, he's aware of some of them at least. He found them especially useful in converting the Raven to something other than, for lack of a better term, a shithole.
{[b]Angelo:} That was partly your doing? Very impressive. The Raven is glorious. I feel very at home.
{[b]Siennis:} I am pleased to hear it. Some comfort in these troubling times is all we can hope for.
{[i]They return to the Raven and part ways. Angelo either regroups with the party or goes straight to bed, depends, and Siennis goes to talk to Andraki Lenn, the goodest boi.}`

`{[h]Doing some quick planning and evening discussion }
[It’s the 22nd, but it’s late at night so it’s about to be the 23rd]
Angelo retroactively asks Sheyla and Killiar for an amulet of non-detection like the one Vilgrim had. Now no-one within 10ft of Angelo can be scryed on. We also decide to go to Elsir Cross during the two days of downtime we have before Jazzir’s potion is done. Ganraz raises the point that nipping straight over to the Ghostlord has reward, but also a hell of a lot of risk. Maybe focusing on Hammerfist Hold first would be best. Seamus and Angelo are inclined to agree.
We have a vague plan, so the party head out of the council chamber.
The grounds of the manor houses are being used as camping grounds for the refugees. Lady Kaal has agreed to have her manor grounds used, and the majority of the refugees we personally know will have gone there for the night.
Sellyr pings us, which she’s been doing periodically. She sends it to Ganraz, and he replies, “The situation has changed, siege approaches. One dragon slain. Aleya died fighting the enemy. Please send me phylactery. Thank you for your trust and help.” There is a pause, and then she sends again. “I had heard of the dragon’s fall.” She agrees to send us the phylactery. Ganraz is in the corridor, and a leaf blows past him. A writhing mass of roots and leaves form a circular portal, creating a shimmering barrier in the corridor, and a lead lined box extends through the portal. The roots place it on the ground at his feet. He puts his box in his bag of holding, and then heads to see the refugees.
Angelo catches up to Siennis for a chat.
Brande goes off to find Jazzir.
Seamus took the kids to the camp earlier, so he knows they’re fine. He does have the option of taking the kids to stay with him in the Raven, but decides against it. Ganraz heads towards Kaal manor, which is beautiful, and surrounded by acres of tents. It’s well organised, and some people are still revelling around campfires. Ganraz thinks about seeking out Markos first, who doesn’t fully know that Aleya’s dead yet. But then changes his mind, it’s a pretty heavy conversation, so he waits until the next time they see each other. He instead seeks out Elaine.
Markos and Jast are elsewhere, but Ganraz speaks to Hardag, asking where he can find Elaine. He’s pointed in the right direction. He reaches a larger tent, with a thin light peeking through the gap in the entrance. Ganraz enters quietly but not stealthily, so he doesn’t wake up the kids but he’s not creeping. Elaine is quietly stroking Tressa’s hair. The half-elven woman is probably a few weeks away from giving birth.
She struggles to get up, telling him they should talk outside. They both exit the tent and find a quiet section of the beautiful garden that’s not currently being used as a camping ground. They sit on a bench near some apple trees. She kisses him, and the kiss is returned with authority. He apologises for being away for a while, and she jokes about trouble following them. Lights glitter and float around the gardens; Veressa Kaal is a very rich woman. Elaine is sad that the refugees will have to leave so soon. Ganraz says he wishes it was as they’d hoped, that they could have arrived and settled, but the Breakers have work to do. She asks if he noticed the captain of the airship Vilgrim left on. He tells her it was Eirros Lyrander, who she does recognise and would have considered a friend once. She doesn’t think he was involved in what happened. She’s worried that any of the other houses might be aware of them, and it won’t end well for them. Ganraz suggests that his Breaker status might protect the two lovers from the Houses. He then goes on to discuss the thing he was sent to kill, and tells Elaine that it killed Aleya. She had assumed the worst. Ganraz blames himself for Aleya’s death, because she came to help Ganraz with his hunt. Elaine reminds him she doesn’t like his archaic contracts, but he says he’s not doing it for the House anymore, he’s doing it to avenge Aleya. He then promises that he will do his best to stay with her for the rest of his life, and they’ll figure out the future from there. Elaine’s dragonmark peeks out from under her sleeve. She knows Ganraz doesn’t like fame, but the Breakers have inspired a lot of the refugees, and she’s proud of him. She also tells him to kill Mr Flay for himself, for Aleya, and for the children. She also adds that he should know by now that it’s definitely children, not child. They need to think of names. [The party weigh in that names like Aleya, Varic, these are good names] Ganraz promises that everything’s going to be ok, he can feel it. [The party groan, he’s basically sacrificed himself, damn it Ganraz that’s a death knell]. Elaine says he should probably speak to Markos, as he’s not going to abandon the refugees now due to his own nature as a Cyran. Markos and Jast and Robin agreed to protect Elaine at Ganraz’s request. She thinks she’ll also be safe with Elise and Itaan, especially as Itaan is trained in the medical arts. She asks how long Ganraz will be around, and he lets her know the party plan to head out to Elsir Cross to deal with some baron. Ganraz offers for Elaine to stay with him in the Gilded Raven tonight, so she can have a bath and a bed, and they tell Hardag to look after the kids.
We all eventually regroup at the Raven, so Angelo and Siennis see them come in. Andraki the goodest boi is there to greet us, and is happy to see Ganraz. He’s also really happy to meet Elaine, and asks if they need anything, to which Ganraz says all the pillows. Andraki takes that very seriously and he’s very drunk, so their room ends up having quite a few pillows. Angelo sees them, and doesn’t comment – now that Aleya isn’t here, he’s the only party member who has a clearer idea of what’s going on between them, as he knows about the twins. Siennis obviously has no clue who Elaine is.
Brande goes to Jazzir’s study, having expressed a wish to speak with him. Jazzir has found some information on what Brande asked him to find – he asked Jazzir to look into Tine Siorai, as his clan of Kenna seem to be the only ones who worship or have even heard of it. He asked if Jazzir had heard to Tine Siorai fighting dragons before. Jazzir tells him that Tine Siorai is an interesting figure, and in one book he found more recent lesser-known religions, like Brande’s. Brande glimpses over Jazzir’s shoulder, a desk further back with a shard similar to the one in the wizard’s staff, with a blue aura around it. Jazzir sees him look back, and tells him he’s enchanting the shard to have a repulsion magic to combat the Field of Wounds. In any case – Tine Siorai is supposedly a divergent representation of the Silver Flame, which has to be briefly explained to Brande. The parallels between the flame giving life and hero souls returning to the flame and Tine Siorai’s stories are obvious. But Tine Siorai’s legend is about 300 years old, and the story has changed by word-of-mouth edits, and had the added aspect of the followers of Tine Siorai gaining visions. So essentially, for the past 300 years the creation myth of Tine Siorai has developed into what Brande knows it to be now. It seems to be specific to the desert Brande grew up in. For everywhere else, it’s been largely written off as a version of the Silver Flame. Brande has a lot to think about.
Jazzir goes on to ask what Brande’s visions are about, whether they are dreams or something else. Brande describes them as goals or instructions, which are usually wreathed in flame. Jazzir makes a quick history check. He hasn’t heard of any entities giving visions in the form of flames. Brande says that the visions do seem to be related; he saw The Mourning before it happened, and he saw the party and then met them, he saw the city of Rhest etc. The revelation that Brande had some level of divination makes Jazzir hesitate. He thinks it’s troubling, but Brande thinks it’s more like a blessing. Jazzir says he hasn’t heard of an entity like this, and worries that there are entities that have malicious intent. He asks if Brande has spoken to Siennis, but he hasn’t. Jazzir advises him that the religion seems harmless, but voices in his head, and divination, these are things Brande shouldn’t trust. One last thing, Brande brings up the red gem he showed Angelo. Jazzir recognises it as some sort of dragon shard. It’s a fragment of a whole, and he can’t tell what the whole is, but some enchantment has changed its colouration. Brande confirms he saw it in one of his visions. House Tharasshk were particularly interested in acquiring dragonshards. Veressa Kaal probably has some, maybe Lord ir’Jarmaath, but they’re very expensive and very rare. There are some within the cathedral of the sovereigns. Jazzir will reach out and try to see who might know more about the shards. He cautions Brande one more time to be careful. Brande also asks Jazzir to keep this discussion between them both.
[We break for dinner, and the party goes to bed]

{[h]In the morning}
[It’s the 23rd Eyre today]
We wake up, feeling a bit stronger now as we’re level 8 officially. We head downstairs for breakfast, and Andraki isn’t in. Siennis would know that Andraki is probably out trying to procure some transport. Elaine is with us, and Seamus asks if she just left Meryll and Tressa alone, and then if she thinks they’d be happier to hang out in the Raven. Siennis casts Thought Shield [we briefly ponder why in the world she’d need to cast that, but we go with it] Siennis joins us at the table as they’re talking, asking if she’s welcome to sit.
She says she’s spoken to Angelo a little now, but doesn’t really know the others. She asks who Elaine is and asks about her stay. She also lets Elaine know that the kids are welcome to stay. Elaine looks around at the expensive ornaments in the room, and says she might need to have a word with Meryll before he comes to visit the Raven. Seamus takes out a disk and, using magic, records his own voice saying, “No. Meryll, no.” Elaine remarks that Seamus seems to be experienced with children, and he tells us that he made some for his sons when they were growing up. Ganraz suggests we could just set Meryll on the Red Hand, we’d definitely win. Elaine says that Meryll doesn’t seem to actually distinguish between friend and foe at the moment. Brande is glad he didn’t actually enchant the sword.
As we leave, we see Andraki Lenn packing up his things onto a cart he’s found. He lets us know we can stay in the Raven whilst he’s gone, as he’s leaving soon to try and beat the rush.
Ganraz: We’ll try to keep the damage and looting to a minimum.
Andraki: …I hadn’t considered looting.
Angelo: {[i]Ganraz}.
Ganraz: We’ll also try to keep dragons from burning it down.
Angelo: Ganraz.
Andraki: …oh.
Angelo pushes to the front to try and reassure Andraki. Siennis joins in the fun by also teasing him, and Andraki promises to give us free drinks for life if we keep the tavern safe. Maybe just a year. Elaine lightly scolds Ganraz for teasing Andraki, saying that’s not what she meant by inspiring the people.

{[h]Back to camp}
Markos has gathered a few militia, which he’s trying to organise but they’re scattered. As we near them, Meryll runs forwards past Jast, and Tressa is chasing him, firing the lights out of the little wand Seamus gave her. Jast grabs Tressa as she tries to run past him, and points at Seamus. Meryll sees him too and runs to grab Seamus’ legs, both of them firing questions at him. Whilst he’s talking to the kids, Seamus gives Tressa the disk that says No Meryll.
Markos talks to the rest of us, and he asks if we’re heading out soon. Brande comments on the ragtag group of soldiers. Markos says he’s trying to get them into shape, and also adds that he doesn’t know why we’ve got nicknames but he doesn’t. Markos mentions the arrangement between himself and Ganraz, but in a subtle way, giving him a look to ask if it’s ok to talk about it in front of the rest of the Breakers. Markos has spent his life defending Cyre, and he intends to remain in Brindol to fight. Ganraz asks if Markos has heard about what happened to Aleya. Angelo drifts away from the group here, not wanting to listen. Markos says he’s sad about what happened, that Aleya was a fine soldier, and the people here have lost too much. He also asks about Ganraz’s contract, who says he’ll avenge her regardless of pay. Ganraz reckons it’ll be no issue training the newest recruits. Markos tells him that the refugees are probably done running, and that the people have lost their homes and are willing to fight for a new one.
We have a quick look around, and can see Robin is fine, throwing her daggers at a tree and then summoning them back. She walks over next to Jast. Hardag is there too. Elise ir’Cristole and Itaan exit their tent to check on their belongings being packed up.
Angelo asks Elaine how she is, because he knows she’s carrying twins even if no-one else does. He admits he has very little understanding of medicine, but he does have some grasp of healing magic he can offer her to add to her comfort. She thanks him for the offer, and says that Itaan is looking after her.
The bard then goes and talks to Elise and Itaan, and Elise expresses her condolences for Aleya’s death, making him uncomfortable. She’s due to have an audience with Veressa Kaal soon, and Angelo asks if she wants any support in that meeting. She says she’ll be fine. Itaan has been researching Tiamat, and remarks that it’s unusual for Tiamat to have any followers, let alone hobgoblin followers. Angelo will remember this. Itaan also adds that he’ll go to the library in the Brindol Academy, as the books he managed to save aren’t enough. Siennis follows Angelo, and says Itaan can keep some of her books for her. Angelo formally introduces Siennis to Itaan. He then asks Itaan to continue research on Tiamat, and also research legends and myths around the Elsir Vale itself, focusing on the lich perhaps.
Lady Veressa Kaal steps out of her manor, and Angelo escorts Elise to her. Lady Veressa says she will be happy to receive Elise now. She then confirms Angelo’s identity, and he sketches a bow – in court terms, it’s a very low effort “fuck you” kind of bow. Lady Kaal recognises this immediately, and smiles. She asks about his Breaker nickname, Noble, and asks if he’s of noble heritage. He says he’s a humble bard, serving in many courts, and was known as a singer. He also says he reckons his attire is what prompts people to give him the nickname. Her insight is higher than his deception, so she smiles again and says she’s just a humble businesswoman. Angelo catches that immediately and inwardly curses. She looks forwards to learning more about him soon, and he looks forwards to learning more about her. She then bids him farewell, calling him “Just Angelo.” Ok, ok bitch, I see how it is, Angelo will remember this. He does a lot of muttering to himself in Elvish.
Veressa’s bodyguard, a minotaur named Uud, follows her in.
As we’re leaving the camp, Angelo hangs back to cast Message to Ganraz. “So… have you picked out any names yet? You can reply to this message.” He replies that he has some ideas, but nothing concrete yet.
Siennis walks over to talk to Brande. She asks him about the voice in his head, and then asks if he would allow her to speak telepathically. He does, and she asks about Tine Siorai, and explains a little more on the Silver Flame. She notes that Brande’s religion seems to be different, as Tine Siorai actually speaks to him. Brande explains how TS shows him visions, and gives him some guidance. She rolls a 24 on her sleight of hand, and he only rolls a 23 on perception. So close. She can sense that he’s a bit frustrated because of the questions, and then he’s calm, almost unnaturally calm. He’s also confused, as he doesn’t seem to know as much as he thought he did. Siennis asks if he’s the first of his clan to actually have these visions, but he doesn’t know any living. He summons his bow as an example of what gifts Tine Siorai has given him. She recognises some infernal in the runes on the bow. Siennis rolls an arcana and religion check to see if she knows of any entities that communicate through visions. She knows about some entities that can try to lead people to take certain courses, and it’s possible to be led astray by instructions. She quizzes Brande on how Tine Siorai speaks, what voice it uses, etc. He explains that voice isn’t the right term, and it’s a mixture of things. It’s more a case of being shown a goal to achieve, and it’s Brande’s choice what path he takes to reach that goal. Siennis asks if he can show her, or there is another, faster way. [Mind-reading, say goodbye to your thoughts, Brande] He doesn’t like that, so he shows her an image of the shard instead. She asks what happened at the time he saw it, and he notes she seems to know a lot. She admits to reading a lot of things, particularly about magic and histories and religion. Part of her is curious and part of her is concerned. She apologises for pressing him with lots of questions, and he says it’s fine.
They’ve been talking telepathically for a while, so Ganraz moves nearer to Angelo and says that Siennis is really weird. Angelo comments that we seem to have picked up a mindreader, who can speak in our heads any time she likes, so we can probably expect more conversations like this in the future. Ganraz gives that a big ole hmm.
Brande asks Siennis about the dragonshard. He believes that Tine Siorai is telling him to get one of these to help control his power and control over himself. Siennis says that control over oneself is very important. She then asks what TS has asked him to do in the past. The first vision was what brought Brande to the rest of the group/the caravan. But he considers TS’s visions to all be guidance. Siennis says he has an interesting relationship with TS, and warns him to be careful. There are beings in this world that are very powerful. Events have a way of shaping themselves to a certain path, and sometimes there are beings that try to make sure certain events happen, just as others try to make sure some don’t. Finding that path is no easy task, and he must be certain in himself that he is on the right path. Brande tells her TS hasn’t failed him so far.
Seamus spends time with the kids, “flying” through the trees using his grapple arm. He pretends Meryll isn’t secure, but Meryll likes danger and is hyped. That kid is not afraid of anything.

{[h]To the Dawn Gate}
Ulverth meets us as we prepare to depart, and tells us that Elsir Cross is a bridge town. The town grew to prominence due to lumber trade, and has a large papermill. It’s not extensively wealthy, but it has reasonable trade. Until 10 years ago, the town was run by Elder Dynn, who eventually passed away, and since then Trask has been effectively the de facto ruler of the town. He used to operate a smuggling ring through the Giant Shield Mountains, getting people in and out of Darguun. Since then he’s switched to more honourable businesses. He’s a balding man, and portly, but he’s dangerous, having grown up on the streets. He’ll be in the town hall. Trask has five sons, many of whom share the father’s build and will therefore be easier to spot. Hakkon Trask, the eldest, will most likely be the baron’s right-hand-man.
Jarmaath would like to reaffirm that we are not to try and assassinate Trask, just to meet with him and try to determine why he’s being so cowardly. Ulverth gives the party a diplomat’s pouch; if we write any letter on it, addressed to someone with a diplomat’s pouch, then they will receive the message.
A stablehand bearing a family crest - Teskerwill – comes forwards to hand over the horses. Siennis recognises it immediately, and Angelo rolls 21 on his history check; One of the founding families of Brindol dating back to Rhestan days, the Teskerwills live in this sizable mansion. Their primary interest is horse breeding, and a sizable walled field to the southwest of this mansion houses the best of their stock. Currently, the entire stock of Teskerwill horses has been donated—over the protests of the family patriarch, Owen Teskerwill—to the war effort, placed at the use of the Lions of Brindol for the duration. His name is Bael, and Ganraz asks him if his House has given all of their horses to the war effort. They have, as Teskerwill is loyal, which is incredibly generous. Owen’s three children are all commissioned into the militia as cavalry officers.
We notice that the horses seem nervous around Siennis. Her steed seems to want to refuse the rider, but with the help of the stablehands she manages to get on. Angelo calls out, asking if everything’s all right. She says it’s fine, she just hasn’t ridden much, it’s not her preferred mode of transport, and sometimes it’s just like this. He insight checks. She’s lying. He doesn’t call her on it, he just makes a mental note.

{[h]Elsir Cross}
As we stop on a ridge, the sun setting in the distance, we see Elsir Cross. The town is set on the river, and centres around a large papermill. We ride down to the town, and slow our pace. People muttering as we pass. A man walks out into the road, 100m ahead of us, essentially blocking our path. There are a few men nearby, wearing bright red sashes. He’s got a bit of a shit eating grin on his face, and welcomes us to the town of Elsir Cross. He’s Witt Trask, fifth son of “Baron” Trask. He eyes Ganraz, remarking that he’s not as tall as he’d heard. Angelo is itching to cast Vicious Mockery. Ganraz asks for an audience with the Baron, and Witt is interrupted by a woman named Miha who comes out and says that our audience with the baron is expected. Angelo quietly asks Ganraz what his policy is on casting non-lethal magic on people, because he’s tired and already irritated by Veressa Kaal. Ganraz mutters that if he doesn’t get caught, then…
So, the party is led into the town of Elsir Cross. And we end our session here. `
